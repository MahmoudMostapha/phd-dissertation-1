Two experiments (30%, 80% solid) for comparison    2

Hysteresis:
Show that a convexity can be changed by            1
by changing the material properties (adult)              


Stress relaxation:
Poroelasticity (dynamic) at 3 rates                3
Two viscoelastic curves for comparison (rates)     2
One nonlinear viscoelastic stress relaxation       1
to show that it can be used to model experiment
