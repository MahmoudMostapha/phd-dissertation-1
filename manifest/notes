Conventional wisdom, as passed down to me through my advisor and down to him though his, indicated that a thesis be self sufficient. That a person moderately familiar with the field picking it up should be able to read through, understand, and reproduce what's in it without too much external aid. I have tried to make this work live up to that, within bounds. If you're looking for a level of depth which entails < ... >, you probably have a lot of pre-requisite reading and pondering to do.

That said, there are areas where I've paid innane attention to seemingly trivial (but probably profound, but then again, probably trivial) details. There are other areas where I've knowingly left things said mildly imprecise. This is done with good reason. You need to understand most of what is written here is from the point of view of a simple minded thought-experimentalist trying to rationalize the world around him. There are many ways of seeing the world and the phenomena that occur in it, I've just articulated what it is I've noticed relating to this problem, in the way I know how. Come to think of it, it isn't mildly imprecise at all, just horribly incomplete.

It is not suprising that the degree title post the masters of science is a doctorate in philosophy and not something like "ultimate god in this sub sub sub set of this science", as there is no such thing. <Knowledge is infinite, and the time we have to write such work is extremely finite. For proof, refer figs 1.2 and 1.4 for pictures of the author's poor carpal tunnel syndrome afflicted fingers.>

With regards to other minor details, the notation used is heavily borrowed from the encyclopaediaic treatise by Truesdell and Noll, with some indicial notation borrowed from more recent work. If you're interested in even more minor details, spellings and word selection, for the most part, follow standard Commonwealth English. If there are points where you find their American English counterparts, it is the unfortunate consequence of being exposed to the society for about half a decade of my life.

Other gross errors found are mostly the author's fault. I divert a little of the blame toward insfficiently strong cups of coffee at 3 AM I declare necessary to catch such <mistakes>.
