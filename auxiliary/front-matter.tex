  It took unfortunately too long to dawn upon me, but unlike many of
  my friends and colleagues in graduate school, I've been very
  fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet frequently with my

  The experience has been most enriching, especially
  the conversations with my advisor, Krishna Garikipati, while we were
  attempting to postulate, refine, and validate our ideas; which were
  initially all theirs. Having been provide a great deal of freedom
  to explore independently, I believe I've begun to gather ownership
  of aspects that are important to me.

  Apart from the obvious benefit of the insight of a group of experts,
  these interactions have led

  I'd like to thank Eric~M.~Dede for his TeX interpretation of the
  Rackham style guidelines, upon which this hack is
  constructed. Jakob~T.~Ostien for his constructive comments on very
  early revisions of this document that helped make it more
  accesible. Devin~O'Connor for helping me tweak material modelling
  parameters to better replicate experimental results, making some
  findings seem more relevant than they are.

  My few ``friends'' outside the university who never let me give up
  on graduate school; never letting me forget the reason I've been
  here for so long in the  first place: That no matter how convoluted it
  might seem to correctly construct a linearised tangent-stiffness
  matrix, real life is a lot worse.

  For the NSF, Sandia, the M.E. Department, and all others that've
  funded me through graduate school. For the powers that be that've
  made it so seamless that I haven't even had to know the names of all
  the groups that have foot my bills for so long.
