%% specify the partial stress, $\bP^\iota$, and flux, $\bM^\iota$, of
%% a species. The flux also implies the relative velocity,
%% $\bV^\iota$. The velocity of the solid phase, $\bV$ is obtained
%% from the local form of the balance of linear momentum for the
%% system (\ref{linmombalsys}). With all these quantities known, the
%% individual interaction forces between species,
%% $\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota$, can be obtained from
%% (\ref{ballinmomrefI}). They are, however, not needed while solving
%% for the balance of linear momentum of the system.

%% The theory developed in Sections \ref{sect2}--\ref{sect5} has been
%% implemented in a computational formulation, retaining much of the
%% complexity of the coupled balance laws and constitutive relations.
%% For realistic soft tissue material parameters, the contribution of
%% the fluxes and interaction forces between species to the balance
%% of linear momentum of the composite tissue is negligible. This
%% simplification has been used. As a preliminary demonstration of
%% the theory\footnote{This numerical section has been included
%% mainly for completeness of this theoretical paper. A separate
%% paper, currently in preparation, will present the computational
%% formulation and contain a detailed examination of a number of
%% initial and boundary value problems for growth.}, we present a
%% computation of the coupled physics in the early stages of uniaxial
%% extension of a cylindrical soft tissue specimen. The motivation
%% for this model problem comes from our experimental model of
%% engineered, functional tendon constructs grown \emph{in vitro},
%% having the same cylindrical geometry. The experimental aspects of
%% our broad-based project on soft tissue growth are described
%% elsewhere \citep{Calve:04}. In addition to engineering
%% scaffold-less tendon constructs from neonatal rat fibroblast
%% cells, we have the ability to impose a range of mechanical,
%% chemical, nutritional and electrical stimuli on them and study the
%% tissue's response. Besides modelling these experiments, the
%% mathematical formulation described here presents researchers with
%% a vehicle for testing scenarios and framing hypotheses that can be
%% experimentally-validated in our laboratory, thereby driving the
%% experimental studies.

%% %\subsection{Boundary and initial conditions; coupled solution method}
%% %\label{}

%% Boundary conditions for mass transport consisted of the specified
%% fluid concentration at all external surfaces of the cylinder. This
%% value was fixed at $500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3}$. With these boundary
%% conditions the fluid flux normal to surfaces of the specimen is
%% determined by solving the initial and boundary value problem. The
%% bottom planar surface was fixed in the $\be_3$ direction and a
%% displacement was applied at the top surface, also in the $\be_3$
%% direction, to give a nominal strain rate of
%% $0.05\,\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ in the $\be_3$ direction. This is the
%% only mechanical load on the problem. Initial conditions were
%% $\rho_0^\mathrm{f}(\bX,0) =
%% 500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3},\;\rho_0^\mathrm{s}(\bX,0) =
%% 500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3}$, and for the mechanical problem,
%% $\bu(\bX,0) = \bzero,\,\bV(\bX,0) = \bzero$.

%% The coupled problem was solved by a staggered scheme based upon
%% operator splits
%% . The details 
%% will be presented in a future communication that will focus upon
%% computational aspects and numerical examples. Here we only mention
%% that the staggered scheme consists of identifying the displacement
%% and species concentrations as primitive variables associated with
%% the mechanical and mass transport problems. The mechanical problem
%% is solved holding the concentrations fixed. The resulting
%% displacement field is then held constant to solve the mass
%% transport problem. The transient solution is obtained for
%% mechanics using energy-momentum conserving schemes
%% \citep{SimoTarnow:1992b,SimoTarnow:1992a,Gonzalezphd:1996}, and
%% for mass transport using the Backward Euler Method. Hexahedral
%% elements are employed, combined with nonlinear projection methods
%% \citep{simotaylorpister:85} to treat the near-incompressibility
%% imposed by the fluid. The numerical formulation has been
%% implemented within the nonlinear finite element program, FEAP
%% \citep{feapmanual}.

%% somewhat slow convergence with respect to number of passes, due to the strong coupling of this problem.
%% (One pass is completed when all equations have been solved once.) In Section 5 we demonstrate how
%% this analysis can be extended to the reformulation of the growth problem, by solution of the detailed
%% solid and 
%% uid momentum balance equations, that is being advocated in this proposal.

%% \end{figure}

%% The flux contributions in Figures \ref{M1fig}--\ref{Mfig} can be
%% summarized as follows: The fluid flux is dominated by the
%% contribution from the stress gradient in the $\be_3$ direction.
%% The latter arises as the stress ($\sigma_{33}$) wave of tension
%% travels down the cylinder in the first few microseconds after
%% application of the load (the time taken to travel the length of
%% the cylinder is $12 \,\mu\mathrm{sec}$). Additionally, as the
%% fluid concentration changes due to the flux, it causes a further
%% change in the stress (Section \ref{sect5}). Other flux terms are
%% qualitatively sensible; i.e., their directions are consistent with
%% the physics of the problem, as argued in each of the figure
%% captions\footnote{In order to compare the flux contributions, they
%% have all been plotted on the same scale: $-1\times
%% 10^{-4}--1\times 10^{-4} \,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-2}\mathrm{sec}$.
%% However the plots also show the maximum and minimum field values
%% at the top and bottom of the legend bars. These values represent a
%% better comparison of the relative flux magnitudes.}. There is some
%% loss of axial symmetry in a few of the plots due to the coarseness
%% of the finite element mesh for this example. It appears that
%% spatial oscillations in the solution lead to a further loss of
%% symmetry in Figures \ref{M2fig}b--\ref{M3fig}b and \ref{Mfig}a.
%% These oscillations arise due to large and dominant advective
%% terms, and need to be remedied by stabilized finite element
%% methods. Here, we only aim to demonstrate that various driving
%% forces for mass transport are in agreement with their theoretical
%% underpinnings in the paper. The resorption of the solid phase is
%% shown indirectly in Figure \ref{Pifig}. A positive fluid source,
%% $\Pi^\mathrm{f}$, means that $\Pi^\mathrm{s} < 0$. Since
%% $\Pi^\mathrm{s}$ is the only term balancing
%% $\partial\rho_0^\mathrm{s}/\partial t$ [see (\ref{massballocA})],
%% it follows that $\partial\rho_0^\mathrm{s}/\partial t < 0$.
