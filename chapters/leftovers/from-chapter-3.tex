%% specify the partial stress, $\bP^\iota$, and flux, $\bM^\iota$, of
%% a species. The flux also implies the relative velocity,
%% $\bV^\iota$. The velocity of the solid phase, $\bV$ is obtained
%% from the local form of the balance of linear momentum for the
%% system (\ref{linmombalsys}). With all these quantities known, the
%% individual interaction forces between species,
%% $\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota$, can be obtained from

%% for the balance of linear momentum of the system.

%% The theory developed in Sections \ref{sect2}--\ref{sect5} has been
%% implemented in a computational formulation, retaining much of the
%% complexity of the coupled balance laws and constitutive relations.
%% For realistic soft tissue material parameters, the contribution of
%% the fluxes and interaction forces between species to the balance
%% of linear momentum of the composite tissue is negligible. This
%% simplification has been used. As a preliminary demonstration of
%% the theory\footnote{This numerical section has been included
%% mainly for completeness of this theoretical paper. A separate
%% paper, currently in preparation, will present the computational
%% formulation and contain a detailed examination of a number of
%% initial and boundary value problems for growth.}, we present a
%% computation of the coupled physics in the early stages of uniaxial
%% extension of a cylindrical soft tissue specimen. The motivation
%% for this model problem comes from our experimental model of
%% engineered, functional tendon constructs grown \emph{in vitro},
%% having the same cylindrical geometry. The experimental aspects of
%% our broad-based project on soft tissue growth are described
%% elsewhere \citep{Calve:04}. In addition to engineering
%% scaffold-less tendon constructs from neonatal rat fibroblast
%% cells, we have the ability to impose a range of mechanical,
%% chemical, nutritional and electrical stimuli on them and study the
%% tissue's response. Besides modelling these experiments, the
%% mathematical formulation described here presents researchers with
%% a vehicle for testing scenarios and framing hypotheses that can be
%% experimentally-validated in our laboratory, thereby driving the
%% experimental studies.

%% Boundary conditions for mass transport consisted of the specified
%% fluid concentration at all external surfaces of the cylinder. This
%% value was fixed at $500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3}$. With these boundary
%% conditions the fluid flux normal to surfaces of the specimen is
%% determined by solving the initial and boundary value problem. The
%% bottom planar surface was fixed in the $\be_3$ direction and a
%% displacement was applied at the top surface, also in the $\be_3$
%% direction, to give a nominal strain rate of
%% $0.05\,\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ in the $\be_3$ direction. This is the
%% only mechanical load on the problem. Initial conditions were
%% $\rho_0^\mathrm{f}(\bX,0) =
%% 500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3},\;\rho_0^\mathrm{s}(\bX,0) =
%% 500\,\mathrm{kg.m}^{-3}$, and for the mechanical problem,
%% $\bu(\bX,0) = \bzero,\,\bV(\bX,0) = \bzero$.

%% The coupled problem was solved by a staggered scheme based upon
%% operator splits
%% . The details 
%% will be presented in a future communication that will focus upon
%% computational aspects and numerical examples. Here we only mention
%% that the staggered scheme consists of identifying the displacement
%% and species concentrations as primitive variables associated with
%% the mechanical and mass transport problems. The mechanical problem
%% is solved holding the concentrations fixed. The resulting
%% displacement field is then held constant to solve the mass
%% transport problem. The transient solution is obtained for
%% mechanics using energy-momentum conserving schemes
%% \citep{SimoTarnow:1992b,SimoTarnow:1992a,Gonzalezphd:1996}, and
%% for mass transport using the Backward Euler Method. Hexahedral
%% elements are employed, combined with nonlinear projection methods
%% \citep{simotaylorpister:85} to treat the near-incompressibility
%% imposed by the fluid. The numerical formulation has been
%% implemented within the nonlinear finite element program, FEAP
%% \citep{feapmanual}.
