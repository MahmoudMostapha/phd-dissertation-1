%% The total mass 
%% flux of each species $\iota$ in the current configuration is product
%% $\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}$.

%% Recall that in Section~\ref{balance-of-angular-momentum}, when
%% observing the tissue from a Lagrangian perspective, the partial Cauchy
%% stresses, $\Bsigma^{\iota}$, were found to be symmetric. This section
%% derives the result in terms of spatial quantities.

%% \noindent Motivated by the last term in (\ref{reduced-dissipation%
%%   -fluid}), we specify a frictional force on the fluid phase of the
%% form,

%% \begin{equation}
%% \rho^{\mathrm{f}} \bq^{\mathrm{f}} = - \bD^{\mathrm{f}}
%% \bv^{\mathrm{f}},
%% \label{eu-force-rel-fluid}
%% \end{equation}

%% \noindent where  $\bD^{\mathrm{f}}$ is a positive semi-definite
%% frictional coefficient tensor, the remaining portion of the
%% dissipation inequality for the fluid is:

%% Constitutively prescribing the fluid stress relation
%% (\ref{eu-stress-rel-fluid}) and an interaction force on the fluid as 
%% in (\ref{eu-force-rel-fluid}) results in a priori satisfaction of all
%% the fluid-derived terms reduced dissipation inequality
%% (\ref{reduced-dissipation-fluid}).
