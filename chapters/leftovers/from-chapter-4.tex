%% The total mass 
%% flux of each species $\iota$ in the current configuration is product
%% $\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}$.

%% Recall that in Section~\ref{balance-of-angular-momentum}, when
%% observing the tissue from a Lagrangian perspective, the partial Cauchy
%% stresses, $\Bsigma^{\iota}$, were found to be symmetric. This section
%% derives the result in terms of spatial quantities.
