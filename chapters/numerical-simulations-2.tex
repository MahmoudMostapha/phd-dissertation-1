\chapter{Representative numerical simulations -- II}
\label{numerical-simulations-2}

The theoretical framework developed in the preceding chapter resulted
in a set of coupled partial differential equations governing the
interrelated mechanics, mass transport and biochemistry pertinent to
biological tissue growth. In order to demonstrate the applicability of
the theory, this chapter presents the results of several illustrative
numerical experiments posed within a corresponding computational
framework retaining all aspects of the coupling between the equations.

The chapter begins by providing some insight into the numerical
methods used to solve the coupled equations in Section~\ref{eu%
  -computational-model}. The first set of examples, presented in
Section~\ref{simple-physics}, serve to illustrate basic aspects of the
coupled physics underlying biphasic models for tissue mechanics. In
Section~\ref{biphasic-examples-2}, the biphasic model parameters are
tailored to be more representative of experimental studies on the
mechanics of tendons, and aspects of the time- and rate-dependent
behaviour of the model are explored and compared with experimental
results. The final example presented in this chapter provides a
straightforward extension of the theory to model the effects of the
mechanical environment on growing tumours (Section~\ref{tumour%
  -growth}), evidencing the generality of the proposed formulation.

\section{Introducing the computational model}
\label{eu-computational-model}

The mathematical formulation developed in Chapter~\ref{eulerian%
  -perspective} has been implemented in a finite element setting using
{\tt COMSOL Multiphysics},\footnote{\href {http://www.comsol.com/}
  {http://www.comsol.com/}} a computational environment for solving
coupled systems of partial differential equations. For simplicity, the
numerical implementation is in two spatial dimensions, and it uses
triangular elements of order 2 (quadratic elements) to approximate the
displacement field of the solid phase, and triangular elements of
order 1 (linear elements) to approximate all other field variables,
including the fluid velocity and concentration. A representative
unstructured mesh used in the computations on a unit square domain in
Section~\ref{simple-physics} is shown in Figure~\ref{egmesh2d}, and
consists of 3267 elements.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/examples/%
    eulerian/mesh}
  \caption{A representative unstructured finite element mesh used in
    the computations.}
  \label{egmesh2d}
\end{figure}

In the numerical implementation presented in Chapter~\ref{numerical%
  -simulations-1}, a simplified form of the balance of momentum was
imposed by treating the tissue as a whole and solving a summation of
Equation~(\ref{localbalanceofmomentum}) over all species. This
simplification necessitated additional assumptions on the underlying
micro-mechanics, and these were discussed in
Section~\ref{constriction-1}. In contrast, in the implementation used
in this chapter, the {\em detailed} momentum balance equations are
solved, i.e., each species is treated separately, and coupling between
the mechanics equations of the individual species is introduced by
specifying momentum transfer terms, $\bq^{\iota}$, arising from
frictional interaction as discussed in
Section~\ref{eu-interaction-forces}.

The balance of mass~(\ref{localbalanceofmass}) and
momentum~(\ref{localbalanceofmomentum}) equations for the solid
collagen are solved in the reference configuration of the tissue,
$\Omega_{0}$, and the balance of mass~(\ref{eu-localbalanceofmass})
and momentum~(\ref{eu-localbalanceofmomentum}) equations for the fluid
phase are solved in the current configuration, $\Omega_{t}$. Recall
that this choice is justified because we know the reference
configuration of the solid phase of the tissue. These equations, along
with the saturation constraint discussed below, are solved
simultaneously for the for the solid
concentration,~$\rho_{0}^{\mathrm{c}}$, and
displacement,~$\bu^{\mathrm{c}}$; and the fluid
concentration,~$\rho^{\mathrm{f}}$, velocity,~$\bv^{\mathrm{f}}$, and
pressure,~$p^{\mathrm{f}}$. Variable-order backward difference
formulae \citep{leveque2007} are used for forwarding the equations
through time.

In the interest of generality, the formulation and corresponding
implementation presented in Chapters~\ref{lagrangian-perspective} and
\ref{numerical-simulations-1} allowed for the possibility of
cavitation in tissues under certain ex~vivo/in~vitro
conditions. However, since it is well established that, under normal
physiological conditions, soft tissues are fully saturated by the
fluid, this saturation condition will be imposed in the following
calculations.

The concentration of each species~$\iota$ can be expressed as the
product of two scalar fields: $\rho^\iota = \phi^\iota
\tilde{\rho}^\iota$, where $\phi^\iota$ is the volume fraction and
$\tilde{\rho}^\iota$ is the intrinsic density of species~$\iota$
\citep{passmanetal}, and the mixture is said to be saturated if the
total volume fraction, $\phi = \sum\limits_{\iota}\phi^\iota =
1$. Since the solute species are present only in very low
concentrations, the above condition can be suitably approximated
by:\footnote{The saturation condition, as stated in Equation
  (\ref{eu-saturationconstraint}), incorporates an implicit assumption
  that the solid and fluid phases of the tissue are individually {\em
    intrinsically} incompressible. This means that their intrinsic
  densities, $\tilde{\rho}^\iota$, do not change under load. This is a
  common assumption employed in soft tissue mechanics
  literature. (See, for e.g., \citet{mowetal1980} and
  \citet{ateshian07}.)}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho^{\mathrm{c}}}{\tilde{\rho}^{\mathrm{c}}} +
\frac{\rho^{\mathrm{f}}}{\tilde{\rho}^{\mathrm{f}}} = 1.
\label{eu-saturationconstraint}
\end{equation}

\noindent In this computational implementation, the fluid
pressure,~$p^{\mathrm{f}}$, is not constitutively specified in terms
of the current concentration of the fluid, and instead serves as an
indeterminate Lagrange multiplier to impose the saturation
constraint~(\ref{eu-saturationconstraint}).

For simplicity, the strain energy function used for the elastic
portion of the response of the solid collagen is the model of Mooney
and Rivlin \citep{mooney1940},

\begin{equation}
\hat{\psi^{\mathrm{c}}} (\bC^{\mathrm{e}}) = \sum\limits_{i,j=0}^{n}
C_{ij} (I_{1}-3)^{i} (I_{2}-3)^{j}
\end{equation}

\noindent (where $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the first and second
principal invariants of the elastic right Cauchy-Greent tensor,
$\bC^{\mathrm{e}}$), suitably decomposed into volumetric and isochoric
parts. A mixed displacement-pressure \citep{ZienkTay:89} formulation
is used to treat the near-incompressibility of the solid phase. Also
for simplicity, the fluid is assumed to be ideal, i.e. the fluid
viscosity, $\mu^{\mathrm{f}}=0$.

\section{Some simple physical tests}
\label{simple-physics}

\textbullet\ And, with all this, we first work on some simple biphasic
examples with arbitrary physical properties to study physical aspects
of the coupling.

\subsection{The swelling balloon}
\label{balloon}

\textbullet\ This first test involves driving the mechanics via fluid
flow. Set up the problem by discussing the initial and boundary
conditions used and reiterating the equations solved. Either work
through the application of FSI boundary conditions in a separate
subsection like below, or just incorporate it into the main text.

\subsubsection{Fluid-structure interaction boundary conditions}
\label{eu-fluid-structure-interaction}

\textbullet\ Since we don't know F for the fluid we don't know Fg or
Fe either. Thus, the new swelling problem is worked out differently
from the older one.

\textbullet\ Follow the paper to say how pressure is converted to a
boundary condition because talking just about velocities (that there
is no relative velocity) doesn't directly specify the relevant
boundary conditions for the solid displacement; which is what we're
aiming to solve for the solid.

\textbullet\ {\bf Results:} The plots show a the solid velocity
variation and x-displacements over the first 3~s. Perhaps mention that
the time-scale is arbitrary. There is initially a slight oscillation
in the fluid flow fields due to dynamics (not apparent in the
plots). Shortly, oscillations fade. The fluid pressure boundary
conditions causes inflow and inability to flow out of other boundaries
corresponds to a force $\bp\cdot\bn$ boundary condition, causing it to
swell outward. This can be tailored to model other interesting things,
like inflation of car tyres.

\subsection{The tissue under constriction}
\label{constriction-2}

\textbullet\ Similar to constriction
problem earlier, aim is to see stress-driven flow. Set up the initial
and boundary conditions for both phases.  Flow arises from the
frictional force and boundary conditions which allow no relative
flow. The plot is asymmetric in the vertical direction because it's
the bottom that's being held fixed.

\textbullet\ Since effects from the dynamics were observed in the
previous example, we explicitly carry out this calculation under
quasistatic and dynamic modes to see the difference.

\textbullet\ {\bf Results:} The plots show the x-displacement of the
solid which is loaded and held fixed after the first 1~s. The
fluid-velocity field is tracked, and watch it die out, over a total of
3~s. The same calculation, as mentioned was carried out under a
dynamic and quasistatic case and the vertical velocity field tracked
at the centre point velocity field dies out differently. This is quite
interesting. This is similar to relaxation of the top-face seen in the
earlier calculation (which was in terms of displacement).

\clearpage

\textbullet\ Now that we're reasonably confident about the fluid flow
fields and have an idea of its effects on the mechanics, we proceed to
tailor the material model, geometry and constants to better represent
actual cases.

\subsection{Stress relaxation}
\label{stress-relaxation}

\textbullet\ Set up the boundary conditions relevant to the
case. Basically pull and hold, and no outflow at the top and
bottom.

\subsubsection{Under different rates of loading}
\label{modifying-load-rates}

\textbullet\ In order to differentiate the effect of load rate. The
results show, as expected, that the faster-pulled case is stiffer,
arising from the higher force from the frictional interaction term.

\label{poro-stress-relax-0p02}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparison with representative viscoelastic curves}
\label{viscoelastic-stress-relaxation}

\textbullet\ This calculation uses a linear-viscoelastic model and is
presented for qualitative comparison. We're interested, as mentioned
in a Section before, in the inelastic behaviour of tissues. The goal
of these examples are not to solve the final problem, but to show that
different cases can be solved reasonably within the framework and show
different results qualitatively and quantitatively. Notice that the
viscoelastic curve does the same general thing.

and it's comparison with experiment is shown below.

\subsection{Hysteresis in the cyclic stress-strain response}
\label{hysteresis}

\textbullet\ Now that we've established a simple pull and hold, we
move onto a more complicated pull and unload. Talk about the boundary
conditions and perhaps provide the 2 experimental results first?

\textbullet\ Since quasistatic and dynamic were found important, we
look at those two cases for a certain ratio of fluid to
solid. Clearly, there is a difference.

\subsubsection{Quasistatic vs. dynamic}
\label{quasistatic-vs-dynamic}

\label{medium-hysteresis-dynamic-0p01-d1p037}
\end{figure}

\textbullet\ Note that the fluid-sloshy-effects go away during the
higher strain ranges where the solid is substantially stiffer.

\subsubsection{Changing load-rates and friction coefficients}
\label{load-rates-and-friction-coefficients}

\textbullet\ We now proceed to change the load rates/friction
coefficients in order to observe effects. Clearly, slower tests tend
the process toward equilibrium and it tends to become elastic,
reducing the dissipation and area under the curve.

\textbullet\ With the fluid (relative) velocities fixed (by the
boundary conditions), increasing
the frictional coefficient 10-fold increases the effects of the
fluid-sloshing dynamics substantially.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Changing the overall shape and stress range}
\label{changing-shape}

\textbullet\ All the plots shown thus far have had the same general
shape, but experiments show different things for different tissues at
different ages. We can easily model this by changing the material
parameters to change the stress-ranges and shapes.

\begin{figure}[!hptb]

\label{low-hysteresis-dynamic-0p01-d1p037}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparison with representative linear viscoelastic
  curves}
\label{viscoelastic-hysteresis}

And, to compare, here are two plots (one for each set of material
properties) using a linear viscoelastic model. Clearly, the visco case
misses the noisyness arising from fluid-sloshing which the poro case
captures. Therefore, combinations must be explored.

\section{Tumour growth}
\label{tumour-growth}

\textbullet\ Introduce the general lack of direct experimental
backing here. And point to the fact that the example will be gradually
built up from scratch to separate effects.

\subsection{Isotropic swelling}
\label{tumour-isotropic-swelling}

\textbullet\ One of the primary focuses of this work is growth, and this includes
kinematic swelling. Try to clarify that the cell concentration is
uniform, and growth is of the collagen network + cells. As a result of
this uniform cell concentration and growth, the solid tends to swell.

\textbullet\ The plots show the radial displacements at two times, and
the evolution of the area.

\subsection{Constrained by a wall}
\label{wall-constraint}

\textbullet\ Now, we're interested in the case where there is a boundary condition
arising from a wall or pressure of some sort, and since we're working
with a dynamic calculation, arbitrary introduction of the wall at some
time is numerically bad. So, we move to soft contact mechanics and
have an exponential rule like so that kicks in gradually. The cells
still don't do any mechanics, yet.

\textbullet\ The plot shows the velocity of the growing tumour
(arrows) and the compressive horizontal stress built up at a certain
time. Notice that the velocity in those regions are zeroing out, as
they should. The temporal variation at that end point is plotted separately.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The mechanics of cells}
\label{cell-roles}

So far, we worked with no mechanics but there are two fundamental
things cells do.

\subsubsection{Inward tug}
\label{inward-tug}

\textbullet\ Cells pull inwards, following this law that says that an
optimal cell-ECM concentration is best for maximum inward
tuginess. Their stress now follows this rule motivated by this paper.

\textbullet\ As a result of uniform cell concentrations, we see
this. As a result of an (arbitrary) heterogeneous contribution, we see
something else. Note that the regions with higher cells pull in more.

\label{tumour-heterogeneous-inward-tug}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Transport of the cells}
\label{cell-transport}

\textbullet\ So far, we assumed that the cell concentration remains
constant in time and space. Now we add an additional differential
equation (advection diffusion reaction governing its
movement). Diffusion is obvious, and the plots below show the cells
diffusing from a central bulb outwards while they proliferate.

\subsubsection{Diffusion and proliferation}

\label{tumour-diffusion-proliferation-100}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cell haptotaxis}
\label{eu-cell-haptotaxis}

\textbullet\ But there is another mechanism for their movement, they
move along the gradients of ECM contributions. This is added as an
additional flux term to the calculation above, and the magnitude of
this mobility is motivated by this paper. Clearly, this effect is
less/more important than general diffusion.

\textbullet\ In order to kick this off, we start with an (arbitrary)
heterogeneous ECM concentration, as shown. Note that the cell inward

directions of the arrows.

\textbullet\ And with this, we have (apart from proliferating and
diffusing), heading toward areas of higher ECM. In these calculations,
growth (swelling) has been turned off and the arrows show the inward
tug.

\subsection{Combining everything}
\label{cacophonous-medley}

\textbullet\ We are finally ready to solve the problem we described
initially. The range of physics incorporated here include, diffusing,
proliferating and haptotacting cells, growth induced by them and
swelling, nutrient is a constant field, growth follows a simple rate
law, soft contact mechanics introduced by the wall.

\textbullet\ Clearly, regions with more cells grow faster, and the
plots show the x-displacement as a measure of swelling. Also, the
presence of the wall biases the growth toward the top and bottom as
seen in experiment. Currently, all this arises out of a growth law
that's independent of stress (isotropic swelling), but with careful
experimental work its form can be fixed. Compare this to the case
where the growth happened without a wall.

% The move to the following perspective was motivated by the fact that
% the earlier formulation, and corresponding numerical examples (cite
% sections on role of mass balance in current conf., the deformation
% gradient split for the fluid, and the numerical example involving
% assumptions on deformation gradient of the fluid) involved
% quantities that, while reasonable from a 
% mathematical pint of view, did not correspond to physical quantities
% of interest in terms of physiological bvps. Point out that it's been
% 2--3 years of refining our understanding and trials with the
% previous code that's led to this point?
