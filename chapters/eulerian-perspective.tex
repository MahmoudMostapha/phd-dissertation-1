\chapter{An Eulerian perspective}
\label{eulerian-perspective}

As detailed at the outset of Chapter~\ref{lagrangian-perspective}, the
continuum treatment presented thus far has stemmed from classical
theories for solid continua, which are traditionally formulated in a
Lagrangian setting. Since our continuum idealisation of tissues
includes fluid components, and material coordinates are, in general,
not known in fluid mechanics, this chapter revisits the derivation of
the governing field equations of growing tissues following an Eulerian
approach.

In this {\em spatial description}, attention is turned to a region of
space coinciding with the {\em current configuration} of the tissue,
where the evolution of field variables of interest are
studied. Remarkably, this dissimilar approach results in a set of
balance equations which are completely equivalent to those deduced in
Section~\ref{balance-laws}, just {\em pushed-forward} to the current
configuration. But more significantly, the spatial approach presented
below naturally leads to a different set of primitive variables more
suitable to physically relevant boundary value problems.

The outline of the chapter is as
follows. Section~\ref{eu-balance-laws} briefly recapitulates the
fundamental quantities characterising the tissue, pointing out
noteworthy differences from Section~\ref{balance-laws}, and derives
the balance laws governing finite deformation growth in terms of
spatial quantities. Section~\ref{eu-entropy-inequality} deduces
constitutive relationships consistent with the entropy
inequality. Finally, certain algorithmic considerations pertinent to
the simulations presented in Chapter~\ref{numerical-simulations-2} are
discussed in Section~\ref{eu-algorithmic-considerations}.

\section{Balance laws for an open mixture}
\label{eu-balance-laws}

We initiate this discussion with the introduction of $\Omega_{t}$, a
temporally-varying closure of an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with a
piecewise smooth boundary, which we define to be our region of
interest. This region of interest is constructed to coincide with the
current position of the solid component of the tissue, and our primary
interest lies in the evolution of various field variables inside
$\Omega_{t}$, as observed from an inertial reference frame.

    continuum-potato-current-configuration}
  \caption{An Eulerian point of view.}
  \label{continuum-potato-current-configuration}
\end{figure}

It is assumed that the there exists a {$\mathit{C}^{2}$} (in space and
time), bijective and orientation preserving map $\Bvarphi_{t}(\bX):
\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{0\} \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$
such that $\Omega_{t} = \Bvarphi_{t} (\Omega_{0})$ for some
convenient, {\em fixed} subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, $\Omega_{0}$. This
ensures that $\Omega_{t}$ evolves in a {\em well-behaved} manner,
disallowing non-physical deformations from being imposed on the
tissue, and affords the application of Reynolds' transport theorem
(Appendix~\ref{reynolds-transport}). The map $\Bvarphi_{t}$ is
visualised in Figure~\ref{continuum-potato-current-configuration}.

Denoting a point in $\Omega_{t}$ by $\bx$, $\bv(\bx,t) =
\frac{\partial \Bvarphi_{t}}{\partial t}$ defines the {\em spatial
  velocity} of the system domain. In contrast to
Section~\ref{balance-laws}, it is recognised at the outset that each
species of the tissue is capable of undergoing its own motion
independent of the solid component of the tissue, and so we introduce
the spatial velocity of an arbitrary species~$\iota$,
$\bv^{\iota}(\bx,t)$, which are assumed to be $\mathit{C}^{1}$ in
space and time.\footnote{It is important to note that these quantities
  are primitive variables in themselves. While these species
  velocities can be formally understood as \mbox{$\bv^{\iota}(\bx,t) =
    \frac{\partial \Bvarphi^{\iota}_{t}}{\partial t}$}, where
  $\Bvarphi^{\iota}_{t}$ is the deformation map of from an arbitrary
  reference configuration of each species~$\iota$ to $\Omega_{t}$
  (shown in the portion of Figure~\ref{continuum-potato-current%
    -configuration} constructed using dashed-lines), the quantities
  $\Bvarphi^{\iota}_{t}$ are neither explicitly defined nor tracked.}
Unlike the corresponding quantities defined in
Section~\ref{balance-of-linear-momentum}, these velocities are defined
to be the {\em total} velocities of each species, not velocities
relative to the solid component of the tissue.\footnote{And, with the
  redefinition of these quantities as total velocities, the velocity
  of the solid phase ceases to be special. This is manifest in the
  forms of the balance laws deduced.}

\subsection{Balance of mass}
\label{eu-balance-of-mass}

We now turn our attention to the evolution of the first of our field
variables of interest, the current concentration of an arbitrary
species~$\iota$ constituting the system, $\rho^{\iota}(\bx,t):
\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{0\} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$. These are defined as the mass of species~$\iota$ per unit
       {\em system volume}, $\Omega_{t}$, and are assumed to be
       $\mathit{C}^{1}$ in time and $\mathit{C}^{2}$ in space. The
       total {\em spatial density} of the tissue can be obtained by
       their summation, $\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho^\iota = \rho$.

With these quantities defined, we have from the conservation of matter
for species $\iota$ over $\Omega_{t}$,

\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\frac{\mathrm{d}} {\mathrm{d}t}\left(\int_{\Omega_{t}}
  \rho^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v \right)}_{\text{Rate of change of mass}}
= \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \pi^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v}_{\text{Mass
    being created}} - \underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \rho^{\iota} \left(\bv^{\iota} - \bv\right) \cdot
  \bn\ \mathrm{d}a,}_{\text{Mass leaving the domain}}
\label{eu-globalbalanceofmass}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\pi^{\iota}(\bx,t)$ is the volumetric source (or
sink) of species~$\iota$, which specifies the species' mass production
rate per unit system volume, and $\bn$ is the outward normal vector
over $\partial \Omega_{t}$, the boundary of $\Omega_{t}$. At this
point, the only restrictions on the source terms,
$\pi^{\iota}(\bx,t)$, is that they be integrable.

On applying Reynolds' transport theorem
(Appendix~\ref{reynolds-transport}) to the left-hand side,

\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial \rho^{\iota}}{\partial t}
\ \mathrm{d}v + \cancel{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota} \bv
  \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a} = \int_{\Omega_{t}} \pi^{\iota}
\ \mathrm{d}v - \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
\left(\bv^{\iota} - \cancel{\bv}\right) \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a,
\end{equation*}

\noindent Gauss' divergence theorem (Appendix~\ref{gauss-divergence})
to the area integral,

\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial \rho^{\iota}}{\partial t}
\ \mathrm{d}v = \int_{\Omega_{t}} \pi^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v -
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \mathrm{div} \left( \rho^{\iota} \bv^{\iota}\right)
\ \mathrm{d}v,
\end{equation*}

\noindent and localising, we arrive at the final form of the balance
of mass of species $\iota$,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho^{\iota}}{\partial t} = \pi^{\iota} -\ \mathrm{div}
\left(\rho^{\iota} \bv^{\iota}\right) \quad \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_{t},
\label{eu-localbalanceofmass}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathrm{div} (\bullet)$ denotes the spatial
divergence operator. This result is consistent with classical mixture
theory \citep{TruesdellToupin:60} and is the current configuration
analogue of Equation~(\ref{localbalanceofmass}).

As in Section~\ref{balance-of-mass}, recall that for an external
observer, the rate of change of mass of the entire system is affected
only by external agents, and is independent of interconversion between
species. From the viewpoint of such an observer, the balance of mass
for the tissue as a whole reads,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{\mathrm{d}}}{\mathrm{\mathrm{d}}t} \sum\limits_{\iota}
\left(\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v \right) =
-\sum\limits_{\iota} \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
\left(\bv^{\iota} - \bv\right) \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a.
\label{eu-systembalanceofmass}
\end{equation}

\noindent Comparing Equation~(\ref{eu-systembalanceofmass}) to a
summation of Equation~(\ref{eu-globalbalanceofmass}) over all species,
which are both valid paths to arrive at the balance of mass of the
tissue as a whole, it is clear that the sources and sinks satisfy,

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\pi^{\iota} = 0.
\label{eu-summationrelationmass}
\end{equation}

An identical relation is obtained by \citet{TruesdellToupin:60} and
others who follow their ideas (see, for e.g., \cite{passmanetal} and
\cite{ateshian07}), but their deduction of this result, and other
similar results involving quantities internal to the system, stems
from an additional assumption that {\em the mean response of a
  heterogeneous mixture obeys the ordinary equations of a continuum.}
This is not something that is explicitly employed in this work.

\subsection{The balance of linear momentum}
\label{eu-balance-of-linear-momentum}

As observed from an inertial reference frame, the balance of momentum
of a species $\iota$ over $\Omega_{t}$ requires,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\underbrace{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\int_{\Omega_{t}}
  \rho^{\iota} \bv^{\iota}\ \mathrm{d}v \right)}_{\text{Rate of change
    of momentum}} = & \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
  \left(\bg^{\iota} +
  \bq^{\iota}\right)\ \mathrm{d}v}_{\text{Resultant body force}} +
\underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\ \mathrm{d}a}_{\text{Boundary traction}}\\ +
& \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_{t}}
  \pi^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\ \mathrm{d}v}_{\text{Momentum being created}}
- \underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \left(\rho^{\iota}
  \bv^{\iota} \right) \left(\bv^{\iota} - \bv\right) \cdot
  \bn\ \mathrm{d}a,}_{\text{Momentum leaving the domain}}
\end{split}
\label{eu-globalbalanceofmomentum}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, in addition to the quantities introduced previously,
$\bg^{\iota}(\bx,t)$ is the resultant body force of {\em external} origin
acting on species $\iota$, $\bq^{\iota}(\bx,t)$ is the resultant body
force on species $\iota$ from {\em all other species in the mixture},
and $\Bsigma^{\iota}(\bx,t)$ is the partial Cauchy stress on species
$\iota$. All of these quantities are assumed to be sufficiently
smooth.

Application of Reynolds' transport theorem
(Appendix~\ref{reynolds-transport}) to
Equation~(\ref{eu-globalbalanceofmomentum}) yields,

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial
  \left(\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right)}{\partial t} \ \mathrm{d}v
+\cancel{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \left(\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right) \bv \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a} = &
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota} \left(\bg^{\iota}+\bq^{\iota}\right)
\ \mathrm{d}v + \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
\Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\ \mathrm{d}a\\ + & \int_{\Omega_{t}}
\pi^{\iota}\bv^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v - \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
\left(\rho^{\iota} \bv^{\iota} \right)\left(\bv^{\iota} -
\cancel{\bv}\right) \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Using Leibniz's product rule, Gauss' divergence theorem
(Appendix~\ref{gauss-divergence}), and the balance of
mass{\footnote{Recognising that the balance of mass need not be
    satisfied exactly, pointwise in a numerical implementation.}}
(Equation~\ref{eu-localbalanceofmass}), we have,

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\cancel{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial \rho^{\iota}} {\partial t}
  \bv^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v} + \int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
\frac{\partial \bv^{\iota}} {\partial t} \ \mathrm{d}v = &
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota} \left(\bg^{\iota}+\bq^{\iota}\right)
\ \mathrm{d}v + \int_{\Omega_{t}}
\mathrm{div}\left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\right)\ \mathrm{d}v\\ + &
\cancel{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \pi^{\iota}\bv^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v} -
\int_{\Omega_{t}}\left(\cancel{\mathrm{div}
  \left(\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right) \bv^{\iota}} +
\mathrm{grad}\left(\bv^{\iota}\right)
\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right)\ \mathrm{d}v,
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent where $\mathrm{grad} (\bullet)$ denotes the spatial gradient
operator. Upon localisation, we obtain the final form of the balance
of momentum of species $\iota$,

\begin{equation}
\rho^{\iota} \frac{\partial \bv^{\iota}} {\partial t} = \rho^{\iota}
\left(\bg^{\iota}+\bq^{\iota}\right) +
\mathrm{div}\left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\right) -
\mathrm{grad}\left(\bv^{\iota}\right) \rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota} \quad
\mathrm{in}\ \Omega_{t},
\label{eu-localbalanceofmomentum}
\end{equation}

\noindent also a result consistent with classical mixture theory
\citep{TruesdellToupin:60}. This equation is the current configuration
analogue of Equation~(\ref{localbalanceofmomentum}).

Neglecting the interaction terms as an external observer, the balance
of momentum for the entire system can be written as follows,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum\limits_{\iota} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
\bv^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v 
\right) = & \sum\limits_{\iota} \left(\int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota}
\bg^{\iota} \ \mathrm{d}v + \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} 
\Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\ \mathrm{d}a\right)\\
- &\sum\limits_{\iota}\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \left(\rho^{\iota}
  \bv^{\iota} \right) \left(\bv^{\iota} -
\bv\right) \cdot \bn\ \mathrm{d}a.
\end{split}
\label{eu-systembalanceofmomentum}
\end{equation}

\noindent Comparing Equation~\ref{eu-systembalanceofmomentum} to a
summation of Equation~(\ref{eu-globalbalanceofmomentum}) over all
species, it is clear that the sources and interaction forces satisfy
the relation,

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\left( \rho^{\iota}\bq^{\iota} + \pi^{\iota}
\bv^{\iota} \right) = 0.
\label{eu-summationrelationmomentum}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The balance of angular momentum}
\label{eu-balance-of-angular-momentum}

Consider the position vector $\bp(\bx)$ of a point on the tissue
relative to a fixed point\footnote{Which may or may not be
  the origin of the system's Euclidean space.} in space. The balance of angular
momentum about the fixed point, as observed from an inertial reference
frame, of a species $\iota$ over $\Omega_{t}$ requires,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\underbrace{\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega_{t}}  \bp \times \rho^{\iota}
  \bv^{\iota}\ dv\right)}_{\text{Rate of change of angular  momentum}}  = 
& \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \bp \times \rho^{\iota} \left(\bg^{\iota} +
  \bq^{\iota}\right)\ dv}_{\text{Moment from body forces}} 
+ \underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \bp \times \left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\right)\ da}_{\text{Moment from traction}}\\ 
+ & \underbrace{\int_{\Omega_{t}} \bp \times
  \pi^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\ dv}_{\text{Angular momentum being created}}
\\ 
- & \underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \left(\bp \times \rho^{\iota}
  \bv^{\iota}\right) \left(\bv^{\iota} -
\bv\right) \cdot \bn\ da,}_{\text{Angular momentum leaving the domain}} 
\end{split}
\label{eu-globalbalanceofangularmomentum}
\end{equation}

\noindent since it is reasonable to assume that the material
comprising the tissue is not a {\em polar material}.\footnote{Some
  materials, for e.g., liquid crystals, become polarised under the
  presence of electric fields and consequently have additional global
  torque contributions to their balance of momentum equations.}

On applying Reynolds' transport theorem
(Appendix~\ref{reynolds-transport}),
Equation~\ref{eu-globalbalanceofangularmomentum} reduces to,

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \bp \times \rho^{\iota}
  \bv^{\iota}\right)\ dv \quad =
& \int_{\Omega_{t}} \bp \times \rho^{\iota} \left(\bg^{\iota} +
  \bq^{\iota}\right)\ dv
+ \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \bp \times \left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\right)\ da\\
& + \int_{\Omega_{t}} \bp \times 
  \pi^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\ dv - \int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \left(\bp
  \times \rho^{\iota} 
  \bv^{\iota}\right) \bv^{\iota} \cdot \bn\ da.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Using Gauss' divergence theorem (Appendix~\ref{gauss-divergence}) and
Leibniz rule, we have the following relations:

\begin{displaymath}
\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}}
  \bp \times \left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\cdot\bn\right)\ da =
\int_{\Omega_{t}}
  \bp \times \mathrm{div}\left(\Bsigma^{\iota}\right)\ dv
+\int_{\Omega_{t}} \Bepsilon\colon\Bsigma^{\iota^{\mathrm{T}}} \ dv,
\end{displaymath}

\noindent where $\Bepsilon$ is the permutation symbol
(Section~\ref{balance-of-angular-momentum}),

\begin{displaymath}
\int_{\Omega_{t}}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \bp \times \rho^{\iota}
\bv^{\iota}\right)\ dv =
\int_{\Omega_{t}} \frac{\partial \rho^{\iota}} {\partial t}
\bp \times \bv^{\iota}\ dv + \int_{\Omega_{t}} \rho^{\iota} \bp \times 
\frac{\partial \bv^{\iota}} {\partial t}\ dv,\quad\mathrm{and}
\end{displaymath}

\begin{displaymath}
\int_{\partial \Omega_{t}} \left(\bp
  \times \rho^{\iota} 
  \bv^{\iota}\right) \bv^{\iota} \cdot \bn\ da = 
\int_{\Omega_{t}}\bp \times \bv^{\iota} \mathrm{div}
\left(\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right)\ dv + \int_{\Omega_{t}}\bp \times
\left(\mathrm{grad}\left(\bv^{\iota}\right)\rho^{\iota}\bv^{\iota}\right)\ dv,
\end{displaymath}

\noindent since $\rho^{\iota} \bv^{\iota}\times\bv^{\iota} =
0$. Substituting these relations above and invoking the balance of
mass (Equation~\ref{eu-localbalanceofmass}) and balance of linear
momentum (Equation~\ref{eu-localbalanceofmomentum}), we obtain,

\begin{equation}
\Bepsilon\colon\Bsigma^{\iota^{\mathrm{T}}} = 0,
\label{eu-localbalanceofangularmomentum}
\end{equation}

\noindent i.e., the partial Cauchy stress tensor, $\Bsigma^{\iota}$,
is symmetric. This classical result is the pushed-forward form of
the synonymous result derived earlier
(Section~\ref{balance-of-angular-momentum}) in terms of the partial
first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

When the balance of angular momentum of the entire system, deduced by
neglecting the interaction terms, is compared to the form of the
equation obtained by summation of the individual balance of angular
momenta (Equation~\ref{eu-globalbalanceofangularmomentum}) over all
species present, one obtains a relationship between the interaction
forces and source terms that is identical to
Equation~\ref{eu-summationrelationmomentum}.

\subsection{The balance of energy}
\label{eu-balance-of-energy}

\section{Entropy inequality and restrictions on constitutive
  relationships}
\label{eu-entropy-inequality}

In contrast with Section~\ref{entropy-inequality}, we assume that the
observer is external to the system and knows nothing about internal
interactions. 

Use an energy that's dependent on internal variables here, allowing for visco-elasticity later.
