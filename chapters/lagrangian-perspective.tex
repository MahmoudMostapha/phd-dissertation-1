\chapter{A Lagrangian perspective}
\label{lagrangian-perspective}

%% TODO:
%%  -  This chapter requires a lot of clean up and the two papers
%%     thrown in need to be meshed cleanly. There are no additions
%%     required to the content. Start working here.

Tracing its origins to mechanics theories for solid continua, the
following formulation for biological growth is developed naturally in
terms of {\em material quantities} defined in the {\em reference
  configuration} of the tissue. During the course of this chapter, the
fundamental field equations of a continuum idealisation of tissues are
derived from general principles governing the behaviour of multiphase
mixtures. Specifically, Section~\ref{preliminary-definitions} helps
define the system and formally introduces fundamental quantities
characterising it. Sections~\ref{balance-laws} and
\ref{kinematics-of-growth}, respectively, present the balance laws and
kinematics associated with finite deformation growth. A fundamental
axiom of thermodynamics, the entropy inequality, and its restriction
on functional forms of constitutive relationships is the subject of
Section~\ref{entropy-inequality}. The chapter concludes with novel
algorithmic considerations
(Section~\ref{algorithmic-considerations-1}) which play an important
role in the computational formulation underlying the numerical
experiments in
Chapter~\ref{numerical-simulations-1}.

\section{Preliminary definitions}
\label{preliminary-definitions}

The tissue of interest is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a
piecewise smooth boundary. At a reference placement of the tissue,
$\Omega_0$, points in the tissue are identified by their reference
positions, $\bX \in \Omega_0$. The motion of the tissue is a
sufficiently smooth bijective map $\Bvarphi: \overline{\Omega}_0
\times [0,T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, where $\overline{\Omega}_0 :=
\Omega_0 \cup \partial\Omega_0$; $\partial\Omega_0$ being the boundary
of $\Omega_0$. At a typical time $t \in [0,T]$, $\Bvarphi(\bX,t)$ maps
a point $\bX$ to its current position, $\bx$. In its current
configuration, the tissue occupies a region $\Omega_t = \Bvarphi_t
(\Omega_0)$. These details are depicted in
Figure~\ref{continuum-potato-mass}. The deformation gradient $\bF :=
\partial \Bvarphi/ \partial\bX$ is the tangent map of $\Bvarphi$.

           diffusing species.}

\end{figure}

The tissue consists of numerous species, of which the following
 groupings are of importance for the models: A solid species,
 consisting of solid \emph{collagen fibrils} and \emph{cells},\footnote{At this
 point, we do not distinguish the solid species further. This is a
 good approximation to the physiological setting for tendons, which
 are relatively acellular and whose dry mass consists of up to 75\%
 collagen \citep{Nordinetal:2001}.} denoted by $\mathrm{c}$, an
 extra-cellular \emph{fluid} species denoted by $\mathrm{f}$ and
 consisting primarily of water, and \emph{solute} species, consisting
 of precursors to reactions, byproducts, nutrients, and other
 regulatory chemicals. A generic solute will be denoted by
 $\mathrm{s}$. In what follows, an arbitrary species will be denoted
 by $\iota$, where $\iota = \mathrm{c,f,s}$.

The fundamental quantities of interest are mass concentrations,
$\rho_0^\iota(\bX,t)$. These are the masses of each species per unit
system volume in $\Omega_0$. Formally, these quantities can also be
thought of in terms of the maps $\rho_0^\iota: \overline{\Omega}_0
\times [0,T] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, upon which the formulation
imposes some smoothness requirements. By definition, the total {\em
material density} of the tissue at a point is a sum of these
concentrations over all species $\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho_0^\iota =
\rho_0$. Other than the solid species, $\mathrm{c}$, all phases have
mass fluxes, $\bM^\iota$.\footnote{Currently, we do not consider
  certain physiological 
processes, such as the migration of fibroblasts within the
extra-cellular matrix during wound healing, which may otherwise be
modelled as mass transport.} These are mass flow rates per unit
cross-sectional area in the reference configuration \emph{defined
relative to the solid phase}. The species have mass sources (or
sinks), $\Pi^\iota$.

%% \hrule

%%  The system is open with respect to mass.
%% The sources specify
%% mass production rates per unit volume of the body in its reference
%% configuration, $\Omega_0$.  As
%% discussed in Section \ref{sect1}, the solid tissue phase has only
%% a mass source/sink associated with it, and no flux. The fluid
%% tissue phase has only a mass flux, and no
%% source/sink\footnote{Considering the case of the lymphatic fluid,
%% this implies that lymph glands are assumed not to be present.}.

%% Since the solid phase, $\mathrm{s}$, does not undergo transport,
%% its motion is specified entirely by $\Bvarphi(\bX,t)$. We describe
%% the remaining species $\mathrm{f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$ as
%% convecting with the solid phase and diffusing with respect to it.
%% They therefore have a velocity relative to $\mathrm{s}$. Since the
%% remaining species convect with $\mathrm{s}$, it implies a local
%% homogenization of deformation. The modelling assumption is made
%% that at each point, $\bX$, the individual phases undergo the same
%% deformation.

%% We define concentrations of the species
%% $\rho_0^\iota=\bar{\rho}_0^\iota f^\iota$ as masses per unit
%% volume in $\Omega_0$. The intrinsic species density is
%% $\bar{\rho}_0^\iota$, and $f^\iota$ is the volume fraction of
%% $\iota$, for $\iota = \mathrm{s,f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$. In an
%% experiment it is far easier to measure the concentration,
%% $\rho_0^\iota$, rather than the intrinsic species density,
%% $\bar{\rho}_0^\iota$\footnote{In our experiments we have measured
%% the mass concentration $\rho_0^\iota$ of collagen in engineered
%% tendons grown \emph{in vitro}. These results will be presented
%% elsewhere \citep{Calve:04}.}. The concentrations also have
%% the property $\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho_0^\iota = \rho_0$, the total
%% material density of the tissue, with the sum being over all
%% species $\mathrm{s,f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$. The concentrations,
%% $\rho_0^\iota$, change as a result of mass transport and
%% inter-conversion of species, implying that the total density in
%% the reference configuration, $\rho_0$, changes with time. They are
%% parameterized as $\rho_0^\iota(\bX,t)$.


\section{Balance laws for an open mixture}
\label{balance-laws}

\todo{Some grand statements about fundamental principles underlying
  the following laws follow go here.}

\subsection{Balance of mass}
\label{balance-of-mass}

Recall that $\Omega_0$ is a fixed volume. The
statement of balance of mass of the solid phase of the tissue,
written in integral form over $\Omega_0$, is

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho_0^\mathrm{s} (\bX,t)\mathrm{d}V = \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\Pi^\mathrm{s} (\bX,t)\mathrm{d}V. \label{massbalintA}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since the solid phase of the tissue does not undergo
mass transport, there is no associated flux. Localizing the result
gives

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho_0^\mathrm{s}}{\partial t} = \Pi^\mathrm{s},
\label{massballocA}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the explicit dependence upon position and time has
been suppressed.

The fluid phase of the tissue, $\mathrm{f}$, may be thought of as
the interstitial or lymphatic fluid that perfuses the tissue. As
explained above, we do not consider sources of fluid in the region
of interest. The fluid therefore enters and leaves $\Omega_0$ as a
flux, $\bM^\mathrm{f}$. The balance of mass in integral form is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho_0^\mathrm{f} (\bX,t)\mathrm{d}V =
-\int_{\partial\Omega_0}\bM^\mathrm{f}(\bX,t)\cdot\bN \mathrm{d}A,
\label{massbalintB}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bN$ is the unit outward normal to the boundary,
$\partial\Omega_0$. Applying the Divergence Theorem to the surface
integral and localizing the result gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho_0^\mathrm{f}}{\partial t} = -
\Bnabla\cdot\bM^\mathrm{f}, \label{massballocB}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Bnabla(\bullet)$ is the gradient operator
defined on $\Omega_0$, and $\Bnabla\cdot(\bullet)$ denotes the
divergence of a vector or tensor argument on $\Omega_0$.

For the precursor and byproduct species,
$\iota=\alpha,\dots,\omega$, the balance of mass in integral form
is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho_0^\iota
(\bX,t)\mathrm{d}V = \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \Pi^\iota
(\bX,t)\mathrm{d}V
-\int_{\partial\Omega_0}\bM^\iota(\bX,t)\cdot\bN \mathrm{d}A.
\label{massbalintI}
\end{equation}

\noindent In local form it is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\rho_0^\iota}{\partial t} = \Pi^\iota -
\Bnabla\cdot\bM^\iota,\;\forall\,\iota=\alpha,\dots,\omega.
\label{massballocI}
\end{equation}

\noindent Of course, this last equation is the general form of
mass balance for any species $\iota$, recalling that in
particular, $\bM^\mathrm{s} = \bzero$ and $\Pi^\mathrm{f} = 0$.
This form will be used in the development that follows.

The fluxes,
$\bM^\iota,\;\forall\,\iota=\mathrm{f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$,
represent mass transport of the fluid, of precursors to the
reaction site, and of byproducts from sites of tissue breakdown.
The sources,
$\Pi^\iota,\;\forall\iota=\mathrm{s},\alpha,\dots,\omega$, arise
from inter-conversion of species. The sources/sinks in
(\ref{massballocA}) and (\ref{massballocI}) are therefore related,
as tissue and byproducts are formed by consuming precursors (amino
acids and nutrients, for instance). To maintain a degree of
simplicity in this initial exposition, we will restrict our
description of tissue breakdown to the reverse of this reaction.

The sources, $\Pi^\iota$ for various species, satisfy a relation
that is arrived as follows: Summing (\ref{massballocI}) over all
species leads to the law of mass balance for the system,
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_\iota\frac{\partial\rho_0^\iota}{\partial t} =
\sum\limits_\iota\left(\Pi^\iota - \Bnabla\cdot\bM^\iota\right),
\label{massballocItot}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the sum runs over all species, with
$\Pi^\mathrm{f} = 0$ and $\bM^\mathrm{s} = \bzero$. Alternatively,
in writing the mass balance equation for the system, the
interconversion terms (sources/sinks) play no role, and only the
fluxes at the boundaries need be accounted for. In integral form
we have
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\sum\limits_\iota\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota
\mathrm{d}V =
-\sum\limits_\iota\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_0}\bM^\iota\cdot\bN
\mathrm{d}A.
\end{displaymath}

\noindent Applying the Divergence Theorem and localizing leads to
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_\iota \frac{\partial\rho_0^\iota}{\partial t} =
\sum\limits_\iota(-\Bnabla\bM^\iota). \label{massballoctot}
\end{equation}

\noindent Comparing the equivalent forms (\ref{massballocItot})
and (\ref{massballoctot}) it emerges that the sources and sinks
satisfy
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_\iota\Pi^\iota = 0, \label{sourcebalance}
\end{equation}

\noindent a conclusion that is consistent with classical mixture
theory \citep{TruesdellNoll:65}. The Appendix~\ref{law-of-mass-action}
contains an example in which the Law of Mass Action is invoked to
describe a set of inter-related sources, $\Pi^\iota$.

\subsection{Balance of linear momentum}
\label{balance-of-linear-momentum}

We first write the balance of linear momentum in
the reference configuration, $\Omega_0$. The body, $\sB$, is
subject to surface traction, $\bT$, and body force per unit mass,
$\bg$. The natural boundary condition then implies that $\bT =
\sum_{\iota}\bP^\iota\bN$ on $\partial\Omega_0$, where $\bP^\iota$
is the partial first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor corresponding
to species $\iota$, and the index runs over all species. Thus,
$\bP^\iota\bN$ is the corresponding partial traction. The mass
fluxes, $\bM^\iota,\;(\iota = \mathrm{f},\alpha,\dots,\omega)$,
and mass sources, $\Pi^\iota,\;(\iota =
\mathrm{s},\alpha,\dots,\omega)$ make important contributions to
the balance of linear momentum, as shown below.

The body undergoes deformation, $\Bvarphi(\bX,t)$, and has a
material velocity field $\bV(\bX,t) =
\partial\Bvarphi(\bX,t)/\partial t$. In discussing momentum and energy, it proves convenient to define a
material velocity of species $\iota$ relative to the solid phase
as $\bV^\iota = (1/\rho_0^\iota)\bF\bM^\iota$. Recall (from
Section \ref{sect2}) that the remaining species are described as
deforming with the solid phase and diffusing relative to it.
Therefore $\bF$ is common to all species. The spatial velocity
corresponding to $\bV^\iota$ is $\bv^\iota =
(1/\rho^\iota)\bm^\iota = \bV^\iota$, by the Piola transform.
Since fluxes are defined relative to the solid tissue phase, which
does not diffuse, the total material velocity of the solid phase
is $\bV$, and for each of the remaining species it is $\bV +
\bV^\iota$, $\iota = \mathrm{f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$. Formally, we
can write the material velocity as  $\bV + \bV^\iota$, $\iota =
\mathrm{s},\mathrm{f},\alpha,\dots,\omega$ with the understanding
that $\bV^\mathrm{s} = \bzero$. Likewise, $\Pi^\mathrm{f} = 0$.
This convention has been adopted in the remainder of the paper.

The balance of linear momentum of species $\iota$ written in
integral form over $\Omega_0$ is,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho_0^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota) \mathrm{d}V &=& \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho^\iota_0\bg \mathrm{d}V + \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota \mathrm{d}V + \int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\Pi^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota) \mathrm{d}V \nonumber\\
& &+ \int\limits_{\partial \Omega_0}\bP^\iota\bN \mathrm{d}A -
\int\limits_{\partial \Omega_0}(\bV+\bV^\iota)\bM^\iota\cdot\bN
\mathrm{d}A, \label{linmombalI1}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $\bg$ is the body force per unit mass, and
$\bq^\iota$ is the force per unit mass exerted upon $\iota$ by the
other species present. Attention is drawn to the fact that the
mass source distributed through the volume, and the influx over
the boundary affect the rate of change of momentum in
(\ref{linmombalI1}). Summing over all species, the balance of
linear momentum for the system is obtained:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho_0^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota) \mathrm{d}V &=&
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho^\iota_0\bg
\mathrm{d}V + \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota \mathrm{d}V\nonumber\\& & +
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \Pi^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota)
\mathrm{d}V + \sum\limits_{\iota} \int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}\bP^\iota\bN \mathrm{d}A\nonumber\\
& & - \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}(\bV+\bV^\iota)\bM^\iota\cdot\bN \mathrm{d}A,
\label{linmombalall}
\end{eqnarray}

The interaction forces, $\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota$, satisfy a
relation with the mass sources, $\Pi^\iota$, that is elucidated by
the following argument: The rate of change of momentum of the
entire system is affected by external agents only, and is
independent of internal interactions of any nature ($\bq^\iota$
and $\Pi^\iota$). This observation leads to the following
equivalent expression for the rate of change of linear momentum of
the system:

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho_0^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota) \mathrm{d}V &=&
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0\bg \mathrm{d}V +
\int\limits_{\partial \Omega_0}\bP\bN \mathrm{d}A \nonumber\\
& &- \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}(\bV+\bV^\iota)\bM^\iota\cdot\bN \mathrm{d}A.
\label{linmombalsys}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Here, $\bP = \sum\limits_{\iota}\bP^\iota$ and
$\rho_0=\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho_0^\iota$. Since both
(\ref{linmombalall}) and (\ref{linmombalsys}) represent the
balance of linear momentum of the system, it follows that,

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota
\mathrm{d}V + \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\Pi^\iota(\bV+\bV^\iota) \mathrm{d}V = 0
\end{eqnarray}

Recalling the relation between the sources (\ref{sourcebalance}),
and localizing leads to

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota +
\Pi^\iota\bV^\iota\right)=0, \label{interforcebalance}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent a result that is also consistent with classical mixture
theory \citep{TruesdellNoll:65}.

Having established (\ref{interforcebalance}) we return to the
balance of linear momentum for a single species
(\ref{linmombalI1}) in order to simplify it. Writing
$(\bV+\bV^\iota)[\bM^\iota\cdot\bN]$ as
$((\bV+\bV^\iota)\otimes\bM^\iota)\bN$, and using the Divergence
Theorem,
\begin{eqnarray}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\frac{\partial\rho_0^\iota}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) +
\rho_0^\iota\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right) \mathrm{d}V =
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V\qquad& &\nonumber\\
+\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\Pi^\iota\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) +
\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota\right)
\mathrm{d}V& & \nonumber\\
-
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bnabla\cdot\left(\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\otimes\bM^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V
& &
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Using the mass balance equation (\ref{massballocI}), and
applying the product rule to the last term gives
\begin{eqnarray}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho_0^\iota\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) \mathrm{d}V &=&
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V\nonumber\\
& &+
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota-\left(\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\bM^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Localizing this result gives the balance of linear
momentum for a single species in the reference configuration:

\begin{equation}
\rho_0^\iota\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)
= \rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right) +
\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota-\left(\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\bM^\iota
\label{ballinmomrefI}
\end{equation}

The balance of linear momentum for a single species in the current
configuration, $\Omega_t$, is obtained via similar arguments and
the Reynolds Transport Theorem:
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^\iota\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\bv+\bv^\iota\right)
&=& \rho^\iota\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right) +
\Bnabla_x\cdot\Bsigma^\iota\nonumber\\
& & - \left(\Bnabla_x\left(\bv+\bv^\iota\right)\right)\bm^\iota -
\rho^\iota\left(\Bnabla_x\left(\bv+\bv^\iota\right)\right)\bv,
\label{ballinmomcurrI}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\Bsigma^\iota =
(\mathrm{det}\bF)^{-1}\bP^\iota\bF^\mathrm{T}$ is the partial
Cauchy stress of species $\iota$.

\hrule

In soft tissues, the species production rate and flux that appear on
the right hand-side in Equations~(\ref{massbalance1}) and
(\ref{massbalcurr}), are strongly 
dependent on the local state of stress. To correctly model this
coupling, the balance of linear momentum should be solved to determine
the local state of strain and stress.

The deformation of the tissue is characterised by the map
$\Bvarphi(\bX,t)$. Recognising that, in tendons, the solid collagen
fibrils and fibroblasts do not undergo mass
transport, the material velocity of this species, $\bV =
\partial\Bvarphi/\partial t$, is used as the primitive variable for
mechanics. Each remaining species can undergo mass transport relative
to the solid collagen. For this purpose, it is useful to define the
material velocity of a 
species $\iota$ \emph{relative to the solid skeleton} as: $\bV^\iota =
(1/\rho_0^\iota)\bF\bM^\iota$. Thus, the total material velocity of a
species $\iota$ is $\bV+\bV^\iota$.

The total first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\bP$, is the sum of
the partial stresses $\bP^{\,\iota}$ (borne by a species $\iota$) over all
the species present. Recognizing that solutes in low concentrations,
and do not bear 
  appreciable stress, the partial stresses and momentum balance
  equation are defined only for the solid collagen and fluid
  phases. With the introduction 
  of these quantities, the 
balance of linear momentum in local form over $\Omega_0$ for solid
collagen and fluid is,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho_0^\iota\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) &
=\rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right) +
\mathrm{\small{DIV}}[\bP^{\,\iota}]\\ 
& \quad -\left(\mathrm{\small{GRAD}}\left[\bV+
  \bV^\iota\right]\right)\bM^\iota, \quad \iota = \mathrm{c,f}
\label{linearmombalance}
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $\bg$ is the body force per unit mass, and $\bq^\iota$
is an interaction term denoting the force per unit mass exerted upon
$\iota$ by all other species present. The final term with the
(reference) gradient denotes the contribution of the flux to the
balance of momentum. In practise, the relative magnitude of the fluid
mobility (and hence flux) is small, so the final term on the right
hand side of Equation~(\ref{linearmombalance}) is negligible,
resulting in a more classical form of the balance of
momentum. Furthermore, in the absence of significant acceleration of
the tissue during growth, the left hand-side can also be neglected,
reducing (\ref{linearmombalance}) to the quasi-static balance of
linear momentum.

The balance of momentum of the entire tissue is obtained by summing
Equation~(\ref{linearmombalance}) over $\iota = \mathrm{c,f}$. Additionally,
recognising that the rate of change of momentum of the entire tissue
is affected only by external agents and is independent of internal
interactions, the following relation arises.

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\iota =
  \mathrm{c}}^\mathrm{f}\left(\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota+\Pi^\iota
\bV^\iota 
\right)= 0. \label{qrelation}
\end{equation}

\noindent This is also consistent with Classical Mixture Theory
\citep{TruesdellNoll:65}. See \citet{growthpaper} for further
details on balance of linear momentum, and the formulation of
balance of angular momentum. We only note here that the latter
principle leads to a symmetric partial Cauchy stress,
$\Bsigma^\iota$ for each species in contrast with the unsymmetric
Cauchy stress of \cite{EpsteinMaugin:2000}.

\subsection{Balance of angular momentum}
\label{balance-of-angular-momentum}

For the purely mechanical theory, balance of
angular momentum implies that the Cauchy stress is symmetric:
$\Bsigma^\iota = \Bsigma^{\iota^\mathrm{T}}$. We now re-examine
this result in the presence of mass transport. At the outset one
might expect a statement on the symmetry of some stress or
stress-like quantity. We derive this result for any species,
$\iota$, beginning with the integral form of balance of angular
momentum written over $\Omega_0$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \Bvarphi
\times \rho^\iota_0(\bV+\bV^\iota)\mathrm{d}V &=&
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bvarphi\times\left[\rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota\right)+\Pi^\iota\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right]\mathrm{d}V\nonumber\\
& &+
\int\limits_{\partial\Omega_0}\Bvarphi\times\left(\bP^\iota-\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\otimes\bM^\iota\right)\bN
\mathrm{d}A
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Applying properties of the cross product, the Divergence
Theorem and product rule gives
\begin{eqnarray}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\bV\times\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota +
\Bvarphi\times \left(\frac{\partial\rho^\iota_0}{\partial

t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\mathrm{d}V =\qquad\quad& &\nonumber\\
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bvarphi\times\rho^\iota_0\left(\bg+\bq^\iota+\Pi^\iota\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\mathrm{d}V& &\nonumber\\
 +
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\Bvarphi\times\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota-\Bvarphi\times\left(\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\bM^\iota\right)\right)\mathrm{d}V

\mathrm{d}V & &\nonumber\\
-
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bepsilon\colon\left(\left(\bP^\iota-\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\otimes\bM^\iota\right)\bF^\mathrm{T}\right)\mathrm{d}V,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\Bepsilon$ is the permutation symbol, and
$\Bepsilon\colon\bA$ is written as $\epsilon_{ijk}A_{jk}$ in
indicial form, for any second-order tensor $\bA$. Using the mass
balance equation (\ref{massballocI}), and balance of linear
momentum (\ref{ballinmomrefI}), we have
\begin{displaymath}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\bV\times\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota\mathrm{d}V =
-\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bepsilon\colon\left(\left(\bP^\iota-\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\otimes\underbrace{\bM^\iota}_{\rho_0^\iota\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota}\right)\bF^\mathrm{T}\right)\mathrm{d}V.
\end{displaymath}

\noindent Recalling the relation of the permutation symbol to the
cross product, and the indicated relation between $\bM^\iota$ and
$\bV^\iota$ leads to
\begin{equation}
\bzero =
-\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\Bepsilon\colon\left(\left(\bP^\iota-\bV^\iota\otimes\rho_0^\iota\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota\right)\bF^\mathrm{T}\right)\mathrm{d}V.
\end{equation}

\noindent Localizing this result and again applying the properties
of the permutation symbol we are led to the symmetry condition,
\begin{equation}
\left(\bP^\iota-\bV^\iota\otimes\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota\right)\bF^\mathrm{T}
=
\bF\left(\bP^\iota-\bV^\iota\otimes\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota\right)^\mathrm{T}.
\end{equation}

\noindent But, $(\bV^\iota\otimes\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota)\bF^\mathrm{T}
= \bV^\iota\otimes\bV^\iota$. Thus, the symmetry
$\bP^\iota\bF^\mathrm{T} = \bF(\bP^\iota)^\mathrm{T}$ that results
from conservation of angular momentum for the purely mechanical
theory, is retained in this case. The partial Cauchy stresses are
therefore symmetric: $\Bsigma^\iota = \Bsigma^{\iota^\mathrm{T}}$.
This is in contrast with the non-symmetric Cauchy stress arrived
at by \citet{EpsteinMaugin:2000}. The origin of this difference
lies in the fact that these authors use a single species with $\bV
=
\partial\Bvarphi/\partial t$ as the material velocity, rather than
multiple species with material velocities $\bV + \bV^\iota$.

\subsection{Balance of energy}
\label{balance-of-energy}

Since mass is undergoing transport with respect to $\sB$, and
inter-conversion between species $\iota =
\mathrm{s},\alpha,\dots,\omega$, it is appropriate to work with
energy and energy-like quantities per unit mass. In addition to
the terms introduced in previous sections, the internal energy per
unit mass of species $\iota$ is denoted $e^\iota$; the heat supply
to species $\iota$ per unit mass of that species is $r^\iota$; and
the partial heat flux vector of $\iota$ is $\bQ^\iota$, defined on
$\Omega_0$. An interaction energy appears between species: The
energy transferred to $\iota$ by all other species is
$\tilde{e}^\iota$, per unit mass of $\iota$. In the arguments to
follow in this section we will use the fluxes $\bM^\iota$
\emph{and} the associated velocities, $\bV^\iota$. Working in
$\Omega_0$, we relate the rate of change of internal and kinetic
energies of species $\iota$ to the work done on $\iota$ by
mechanical loads, processes of mass production and transport,
heating and energy transfer:


\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota
\left ( e^\iota + \frac{1}{2} \Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2 \right )
\mathrm{d}V =  \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\rho_0^\iota\bg
\cdot\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) + \rho_0^\iota r^\iota
\right)\mathrm{d}V\qquad& &\nonumber\\
+\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)\mathrm{d}V&
&\nonumber\\
+ \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota
+ \frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V & & \nonumber \\
+\int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}\left(\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\cdot\bP^\iota -
\bM^\iota\left(e^\iota +\frac{1}{2}
\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right) -
\bQ^\iota\right)\cdot\bN\mathrm{d}A. \label{energyspecies1}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Summing over all species, the rate of change of energy
of the system is,

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota \left ( e^\iota + \frac{1}{2}
\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2 \right ) \mathrm{d}V =
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\rho_0^\iota\bg
\cdot\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) + \rho_0^\iota r^\iota \right)\mathrm{d}V& &\nonumber\\
+\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)\mathrm{d}V&
&\nonumber\\
+ \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0}
\left(\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota
+ \frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V & & \nonumber \\
+\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}\left(\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\cdot\bP^\iota -
\bM^\iota\left(e^\iota +\frac{1}{2}
\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right) -
\bQ^\iota\right)\cdot\bN\mathrm{d}A.\quad& & \label{energysum}
\end{eqnarray}

The inter-species energy transfers are related to interaction
forces and mass sources. To demonstrate this, we proceed as
follows: The rate of change of energy of the system can also be
expressed by considering the system interacting with its
environment, in which case the internal interactions between
species (interaction forces, mass interconversion and
inter-species energy transfers) play no role. This viewpoint
gives,

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota \left ( e^\iota + \frac{1}{2}
\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2 \right ) \mathrm{d}V =
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\rho_0^\iota\bg
\cdot\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) + \rho_0^\iota r^\iota
\right)\mathrm{d}V &
&\nonumber\\
+\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\partial
\Omega_0}\left(\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\cdot\bP^\iota -
\bM^\iota\left(e^\iota +\frac{1}{2}
\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right) -
\bQ^\iota\right)\cdot\bN\mathrm{d}A.\quad& & \label{energysys}
\end{eqnarray}

Since (\ref{energysum}) and (\ref{energysys}) are equivalent, it
follows that,

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)
+ \Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V
\right)= 0,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent and on localizing this result,

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)
+ \Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota\right)=
0. \label{energycond1}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent This result relating the interaction energies to
interaction forces between species, their sources and relative
velocities, is identical to that obtained from classical mixture
theory \citep{TruesdellNoll:65}. Together with
(\ref{sourcebalance}) and (\ref{interforcebalance}) it
demonstrates that the present formulation is consistent with
mixture theory.

Equation (\ref{energyspecies1}) for the rate of change of energy
of a single species can be further simplified by applying the
Divergence Theorem and product rule, giving first,

\begin{eqnarray}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\frac{\partial\rho_0^\iota}{\partial
t} \left(e^\iota + \frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2 \right) +
\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2 \right)\right) \mathrm{d}V
=\qquad
& &\nonumber\\
 \int\limits_{\Omega_0} \left(\rho_0^\iota\bg
\cdot\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) + \rho_0^\iota r^\iota +
\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota
+ \frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V& & \nonumber \\
+\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)
\mathrm{d}V&
&\nonumber\\
+\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\cdot\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota
+
\bP^\iota\colon\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\mathrm{d}V& &\nonumber\\
-
\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(\Bnabla\cdot\left(\bM^\iota\right)\left(e^\iota
+\frac{1}{2} \Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)\right)\mathrm{d}V & &\nonumber\\
-\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left( \left(\Bnabla e^\iota+
\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\cdot\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\right)\cdot\left(\bM^\iota\right)
- \Bnabla\cdot\bQ^\iota\right)\mathrm{d}V.
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Using the balance of mass (\ref{massballocI}), balance
of linear momentum (\ref{ballinmomrefI}), and localizing the
result, we have,

\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial t} &=&
\bP^\iota\colon\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)-
\Bnabla\cdot\bQ^\iota + \rho_0^\iota r^\iota
+\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota - \Bnabla e^\iota\cdot\bM^\iota
\label{energybalI}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Summing over $\iota$ gives,

\begin{eqnarray}
& &\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial
t} =\nonumber\\
& &\qquad\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(
\bP^\iota\colon\dot{\bF}+\bP^\iota\colon\Bnabla\bV^\iota -
\Bnabla\cdot\bQ^\iota +\rho_0^\iota r^\iota +
\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota - \Bnabla e^\iota\cdot\bM^\iota\right)
\label{energybaltot}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Substituting for $\sum\limits_\iota
\rho^\iota_0\tilde{e}^\iota$ from (\ref{energycond1}),

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial t}
&=& \sum\limits_{\iota}\left(
\bP^\iota\colon\dot{\bF}+\bP^\iota\colon\Bnabla\bV^\iota -
\Bnabla\cdot\bQ^\iota +\rho_0^\iota r^\iota- \Bnabla
e^\iota\cdot\bM^\iota\right)\nonumber\\
&&-
\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota\cdot(\bV+\bV^\iota)
- \Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)\right).
\label{energybaltot1}
\end{eqnarray}

This form of the balance of energy is most convenient for
combining with the entropy inequality leading to the
Clausius-Duhem form of the dissipation inequality.

\section{The kinematics of growth}
\label{kinematics-of-growth}

The formulation up to this point has introduced some elements of
coupling between mass transport, mechanics and thermodynamics.
Mass transport and mechanics are further coupled due to the
kinematics of growth. Local volumetric changes take place as
species concentrations evolve. As concentration increases, the
material of a species swells, and conversely, shrinks as
concentration decreases. This observation has led to an active
field of study within the literature on biological growth
\citep{Skalak:81,SkalakHoger:96,TaberHumphrey:2001,LubardaHoger:02,AmbrosiMollica:2002}.
Our treatment follows in the same vein.

Finite strain kinematics treats the total deformation gradient as
arising from a geometrically-necessary elastic deformation
accompanying growth, as well as a separate elastic deformation due
to an external stress. The deformation gradient is subject to a
split reminiscent of the classical decomposition of multiplicative
plasticity \citep{Bilbyetal:1956,Lee:1969}

At a continuum point the reference concentration of each species
admits the notion of an ``original'' state in which the
concentration of a species is $\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota(\bX)$. This
is a state that may never be attained in a physical system.
However, if attained, the corresponding species would be
stress-free in the absence of deformation. Neglecting other
possible kinematics (such as plasticity) and microstructural
details, the set of quantities
$\{\rho_0^\mathrm{s},\dots,\rho_0^\omega\}$, and the temperature,
$\theta$, fully specify the reference state of the material at a
point. As mass transport alters the reference density to its value
$\rho_0^\iota(\bX,t)$, the species swells if $\rho_0^\iota >
\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota$, and shrinks if $\rho_0^\iota <
\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota$. Assuming that these volume changes are
isotropic leads to the following growth kinematics: For each
species, one can define a ``growth deformation gradient tensor'',
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota} :=
\frac{\rho_0^\iota}{\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota}{\bf 1}$, where ${\bf
1}$ is the second-order isotropic tensor. The tensor
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}$ is analogous to the plastic deformation
gradient of multiplicative plasticity. As the ratio
$\rho_0^\iota/\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota$ is a local quantity,
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}$ varies pointwise and adjacent
neighborhoods will, in general, be incompatible due to the action
of $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}$ alone. However, further elastic
deformation, $\tilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}$ occurs to ensure
compatibility, leading to an internal stress, that can in general
be different for each species. The action of these kinematic
tangent maps can be conceived of in the absence of external
stress. With an external stress, there is further elastic
deformation, $\bar{\bF}^\mathrm{e}$, common to all species. This
sequence of maps is pictured in Figure \ref{growthkinematicsfig}.
The kinematic relations are:
\begin{equation}
\bF =
\bar{\bF}^\mathrm{e}\tilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota},\quad
\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota} =
\frac{\rho_0^\iota}{\rho_\mathrm{org}^\iota}{\bf 1}.
\label{growthkinematicseq}
\end{equation}

\noindent Clearly, the elastic deformation gradients can be
combined to write $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota} =
\bar{\bF}^\mathrm{e}\tilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}$, the ``total''
elastic deformation gradient of species $\iota$.

     \label{growthkine}
\end{figure}

Local volumetric changes are associated with changes in the
concentrations of the solid collagen and fluid, $\iota =
     \mathrm{c,f}$. If the material of the solid collagen or fluid remains
stress free, it swells with an
increase in concentration (mass of the species per unit system
volume), and shrinks as its concentration decreases. This leads to the
notion of a \emph{growth deformation gradient}. One aspect of the
coupling between mass transport and mechanics stems from this
phenomenon. In the setting of finite strain kinematics, the total
deformation gradient, $\bF$, is decomposed into the growth component
of the solid collagen, $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{c}}$, a
\emph{geometrically-necessitated elastic component} 
accompanying growth, $\widetilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}}$ and an \emph{additional elastic component due
to external stress}, $\overline{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}}$. Later,
we will write $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}} =
\overline{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}}\widetilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}}$.
This split is analogous to the classical
decomposition of multiplicative plasticity \citep{Lee:1969} and is
similar to the approach followed in existing literature on biological
growth \citep[see for
  e.g.][]{Klischetal:2001,TaberHumphrey:2001,AmbrosiMollica:2002}. As
explained in Section \ref{curr-ref-mb}, we assume that the
fluid-filled pores also deform with $\bF$, and that a component,
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$, of this total deformation gradient
tensor, determines the fluid stress. We also assume a fluid growth
component, $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$, which we elaborate below,
and that $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}} =
\bF$. As with the solid collagen we admit $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}
=
\overline{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\widetilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$,
the sub-components carrying the same interpretation as for the solid
collagen. However, we do not explicitly use this last decomposition.

The elastic-growth decomposition is visualised in \mbox{Figure~\ref{growthkine}}.
Assuming that the volume changes associated with growth described
above are isotropic, a simple form for the growth part of the
deformation gradient tensor is

\begin{equation}
\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota} = \left(
  \frac{\rho_0^\iota}{\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^\iota} \right)^
  {\frac{1}{3}} 
{\bf 1},\quad \iota = \mathrm{c,f}
\label{isotropicgrowth} 
\end{equation} 

\noindent where
$\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^\iota(\bX)$ is the reference concentration at the
initial time, and {\bf 1} is the second-order isotropic
tensor.\footnote{This choice is only the simplest possible. Given the
  highly directional micro-structure and mechanical properties of many
  tissues, it seems likely that anisotropic growth is actually 
  more common. Wolff's Law for bone growth is one example. This is a
  topic of ongoing investigation, and one that we will report on in
  greater detail in a future communication.} In 
the state, $\bF = \bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}$, the species would be stress
free. The kinematics being local, the
action of $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}$ alone can result in
incompatibility, which is eliminated by the geometrically-necessary
elastic deformation
$\widetilde{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{\iota}}}$, which causes an
internal, self-equilibrated stress. The component
$\overline{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}$ is associated with the external stress.

\subsection{Saturation and tissue swelling}
\label{saturation-and-swelling}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering 
  \psfrag{A}{\small A}
  \psfrag{B}{\small B}
  \psfrag{C}{\small B}
  \psfrag{D}{\small C}
  \psfrag{E}{\small Unsaturated}
  \psfrag{F}{\small Saturated}
{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/elucidation/composite}}

\caption{Unsaturated tissue in the current configuration (A) allows
  influx of fluid 
  without swelling until it is completely saturated (B). Initially
  saturated tissue (B), in general, swells with influx of fluid (C).}

\label{satswelfig}
\end{figure}

\noindent The degree of saturation of the solid phase plays a
fundamental role in determining whether the tissue responds to an
infusion (expulsion) of fluid by swelling (shrinking). In 
particular, the isotropic swelling law defined by Equation
(\ref{isotropicgrowth}) has to be generalised to treat the case in
which the solid phase is not saturated by fluid.

Figure~\ref{satswelfig} schematically depicts two possible
scenarios. If the tissue is unsaturated in its current configuration,
as in A, then, on a microscopic scale, it 
contains unfilled voids. It is thus capable of allowing an influx of
fluid, which tends to increase its degree of saturation until fully
saturated, as in  B. This increase 
does not cause swelling of the tissue in the local stress-free state, as
there is free volume for 
incoming fluid to occupy. However, once the tissue is
saturated in the current configuration, an increase in the
fluid content causes swelling in the stress-free state, as depicted in
C, since there is no free volume for the 
entering fluid to occupy. It is this second case that is modelled by
(\ref{isotropicgrowth}). It is worth emphasizing that this argument
holds for $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$, which is the local
stress-free state of deformation of the fluid-containing pores at a point. The
actual deformation gradient, $\bF =
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$, also depends
on the the elastic part, $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$, which is
determined by the constitutive response of the fluid. Under stress, an
incompressible fluid will have
$\mathrm{det}\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} = 1$ and therefore a
fluid-saturated tissue will swell with fluid influx, $\mathrm{det}\bF
= \mathrm{det}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}} > 1$. A compressible fluid
may have $\mathrm{det}\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} < 1$ allowing
$\mathrm{det}\bF < 1$ even with
$\mathrm{det}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}} >1$. Even in this case,
however, in the stress-free state there will be swelling.

Therefore, for the fluid phase, the isotropic swelling law can be
extended to the unsaturated case by 
introducing a degree of saturation, $\tilde{v}^\iota$, defined in the
current configuration, $\Omega_t$. We have $\tilde{v}^\iota =
\rho^\iota/\tilde{\rho}^\iota$, where 
$\tilde{\rho}^\iota$ is the intrinsic density in $\Omega_t$ and is
given by $\tilde{\rho}^\iota =
\tilde{\rho}^\iota_0/\mathrm{det}\bF$. Note that the intrinsic
reference density, $\tilde{\rho}^\iota_0$, is a material property. Upon
solution of the 
mass balance equation (\ref{massbalcurr}) for $\rho^\iota$, the
species volume fractions, $\tilde{v}^\iota$, can therefore be computed
in a straightforward fashion. The sum of these
volume fractions is our required measure of saturation defined in
$\Omega_t$. Also, recognizing
that for the dilute solutions obtained with
physiologically-relevant solute concentrations, the saturation
condition is very well approximated by $\tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} +
\tilde{v}^\mathrm{s} = 1$, we proceed to
redefine the fluid growth-induced component of the pore deformation gradient
tensor as follows:

\begin{equation}
\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}  \left(
\frac{\rho_0^\mathrm{f}}{\rho_{0_{\mathrm{sat}}}^\mathrm{f}} \right)^
{\frac{1}{3}}{\bf 1},&
\tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} + \tilde{v}^\mathrm{s} = 1 \\ {\bf 1},& \mathrm{otherwise.}
\end{array}\right.
\label{saturation}
\end{equation}

\noindent In (\ref{saturation}) $\rho_{0_{\mathrm{sat}}}^\mathrm{f}$
is the reference concentration value at which the tissue attains saturation
in the current configuration.

With this redefinition of $\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$ it is implicit
that $\tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} + \tilde{v}^\mathrm{s} > 1$ is
non-physical. Saturation holds in the sense that $\tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} +
\tilde{v}^\mathrm{s} = 1$, and it actually allows $\sum_\iota
\tilde{v}^\iota > 1$ if the sum is over all species. It has been
common in the soft tissue literature to assume that, 
under normal physiological 
conditions, soft tissues are fully saturated by the fluid and
\mbox{Equation~(\ref{isotropicgrowth})} is appropriate for $\iota =
\mathrm{f}$. However, this treatment of saturation and swelling
induced by the fluid phase is necessary background for Section
\ref{tensionfluid} where we 
discuss the response of the fluid phase under tension. This treatment
also holds relevance for partial drying,
which \emph{ex vivo} or \emph{in vitro} tissue may be subject to under
certain laboratory conditions, and is central to the mechanics of
drained porous media other than biological tissue, most prominently,
soils.

\section{Entropy inequality and restrictions on constitutive
  relationships}
\label{entropy-inequality}

Let $\eta^\iota$ be the entropy per unit mass of species $\iota$,
and $\theta$ the absolute temperature. The entropy production
inequality holds for the system as a whole. Accordingly, we write

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}
\int\limits_{\Omega_0} \rho_0^\iota \eta^\iota \mathrm{d}V &\geq&
\sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\Omega_0}\left(
\Pi^\iota \eta^\iota + \frac{\rho_0^\iota r^\iota}{\theta}\right) \mathrm{d}V\nonumber\\
& & - \sum\limits_{\iota}\int\limits_{\partial \Omega_0}
\left(\bM^\iota \cdot \bN\eta^\iota + \frac{\bQ^\iota}{\theta}
\cdot \bN \right)\mathrm{d}A.
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent Applying the Divergence Theorem, using the mass balance
equation (\ref{massballocI}), and localizing the result, we have
the entropy inequality,

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho_0^\iota\frac{\partial\eta^\iota}{\partial
t} \geq \sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\frac{\rho_0^\iota
r^\iota}{\theta} -\Bnabla\eta^\iota\cdot\bM^\iota -
\frac{\Bnabla\cdot\bQ^\iota}{\theta} +
\frac{\Bnabla\theta\cdot\bQ^\iota}{\theta^2}\right).
\label{entropyineq}
\end{equation}

Now, multiplying Equation (\ref{entropyineq}) by $\theta$,
subtracting it from Equation (\ref{energybaltot1}) and using
(\ref{ballinmomrefI}) for $\rho_0^\iota\bq^\iota$ gives,

\begin{eqnarray}
& &\sum\limits_{\iota}\rho^\iota_0\left(\frac{\partial
e^\iota}{\partial t} -\theta\frac{\partial\eta^\iota}{\partial
t}\right) +\sum\limits_{\iota}\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right) +
\frac{\Bnabla\theta\cdot\bQ^\iota}{\theta}
\nonumber\\
& &+\sum\limits_{\iota} \left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) - \rho_0^\iota\bg -
\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota +
\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\bM^\iota\right)\cdot\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)
\nonumber\\
& &-\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\bP^\iota\colon\dot{\bF} -
\bP^\iota\colon\Bnabla\bV^\iota + \left(\Bnabla e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right) \cdot\bM^\iota\right)\leq 0
\label{redentropyineqfin}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Equation (\ref{redentropyineqfin}) is the reduced
entropy inequality---also referred to as the Clausius-Duhem
inequality---for growth processes.

\subsection{The Clausius-Duhem form}
\label{clausius-duhem-form}

As is the practice in field theories of continuum physics, we use
the Clausius-Duhem inequality (\ref{redentropyineqfin}) to obtain
restrictions on the constitutive relations. We begin with very
general assumptions on the specific internal energy of each
species: $ e^\iota = \hat{e}^\iota(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota},
\eta^\iota, \rho_0^\iota)$. Then, applying the chain rule and
regrouping some terms, (\ref{redentropyineqfin}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
& &\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\frac{\partial
e^\iota}{\partial\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}}-\bP^\iota\bF^{\mathrm{g}^{\iota\mathrm{T}}}\right)\colon\dot{\bF}^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}
+ \sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial
\eta^\iota}-\theta\right)\frac{\partial\eta^\iota}{\partial t}\nonumber\\
&+&\sum\limits_{\iota} \left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) - \rho_0^\iota\bg -
\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota +
\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\bM^\iota\right)\cdot(\bV^\iota+\bV)\nonumber\\
&+&\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}\left(\Bnabla
e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right)\right)\cdot\bV^\iota\nonumber\\
&+&\sum\limits_{\iota}\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota +
\frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right) +
\frac{\Bnabla\theta\cdot\bQ^\iota}{\theta}\nonumber\\
&+& \sum\limits_{\iota}\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial
e^\iota}{\partial\rho^\iota_0}\frac{\partial
\rho^\iota_0}{\partial t} -
\sum\limits_{\iota}\bP^\iota\colon(\Bnabla\bV^\iota +
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}\dot{\bF}^{\mathrm{g}^\iota}) \leq 0.
\label{redentropyineq1}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Inequality (\ref{redentropyineq1}) represents a
fundamental restriction upon the physical processes during
biological growth. Any constitutive relations that are prescribed
must satisfy this restriction, as is well-known
\citep{TruesdellNoll:65}. Guided by (\ref{redentropyineq1}), we
prescribe the following constitutive relations in classical form:
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\bP^\iota\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\iota\mathrm{T}} = \rho_0^\iota
\frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}}
\label{stress-constrelI}\\
\nonumber\\
&&\theta =  \frac{\partial e^\iota}{\partial \eta^\iota},\;\forall\,\iota\label{temp-constrelI}\\
\nonumber\\
&&\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota =\nonumber\\
& &
-\frac{\tilde{\bD}^\iota}{\rho^\iota_0}\left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial\bV}{\partial
t} - \rho_0^\iota\bg - \Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota +
\left(\Bnabla\bV\right)\bM^\iota+\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}\left(\Bnabla
e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right)\right),\label{VIconstrel1}\\
&&\mathrm{where}\;\bw\cdot\tilde{\bD}^\iota\bw
\ge 0,\;\;\forall\, \bw \in\mathbb{R}^3\nonumber\\
\nonumber\\
&&\bQ^\iota = -{\bK}^\iota\Bnabla\theta,\;\bw\cdot{\bK}^\iota\bw
\ge 0,\;\;\forall\, \bw \in\mathbb{R}^3\label{qconstrelI}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent With the constitutive relations
(\ref{stress-constrelI}--\ref{qconstrelI}) ensuring the
non-positiveness of certain terms the entropy inequality is
further reduced to
\begin{eqnarray}
& & \sum\limits_{\iota}\left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial
e^\iota}{\partial\rho^\iota_0}\frac{\partial
\rho^\iota_0}{\partial t} - \bP^\iota\colon(\Bnabla\bV^\iota +
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota}\dot{\bF}^{\mathrm{g}^\iota})\right)\nonumber\\
&&+\sum\limits_{\iota}\left(
\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota\cdot\left(\frac{\partial\bV^\iota}{\partial
t} +
\left(\Bnabla\bV^\iota\right)\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota\right)+\Pi^\iota\left(e^\iota
+ \frac{1}{2}\Vert\bV+\bV^\iota\Vert^2\right)\right)\nonumber\\
&&+\sum\limits_{\iota} \left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right) - \rho_0^\iota\bg -
\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota +
\Bnabla\left(\bV+\bV^\iota\right)\bM^\iota\right)\cdot\bV \le 0.
\label{dissipation1}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent The left hand-side of (\ref{dissipation1}) is the
dissipation, $\sD$, a quantity that we will return to below.

Equation (\ref{stress-constrelI}) specifies a constitutive
relation for $\bP^\iota\bF^{\mathrm{g}^{\iota\mathrm{T}}}$, which
is a truly elastic stress. Equation (\ref{temp-constrelI}) implies
a uniform temperature in each species, and corresponds with the
definition usually employed for temperature in thermal physics.
The heat flux in species $\iota$ is given by the product of a
positive semi-definite conductivity tensor, ${\bK}^\iota$ and the
temperature gradient, which is the Fourier Law of heat conduction.
Equation (\ref{VIconstrel1}) requires more detailed discussion
which appears below.

\subsection{Constitutive framework}
\label{constitutive-framework}

As is customary in field theories of continuum physics, the
Clausius-Duhem inequality is obtained by multiplying the Entropy
Inequality (the Second Law of Thermodynamics) by the temperature
field, $\theta$, and subtracting it from the Balance of Energy (the
First Law of Thermodynamics). We assume the Helmholtz free energy per
unit mass of species $\iota$ to have the form:\footnote{Conceivably,
  the mass-specific Helmholtz free energy of one species could be a function of the
  concentration of other species. Ion concentrations, for instance,
  can determine the state of osmotic tension of certain soft
  tissues. Therefore, this choice represents a 
  constitutive restriction.}
$\psi^{\iota} = \hat{\psi}^\iota(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\iota},
\theta, \rho_0^\iota)$.  Substituting this in the Clausius-Duhem
inequality results in a form of this inequality that the specified
constitutive relations \emph{must not} violate. Only the valid
constitutive laws relevant to the examples that follow are listed
here. For details, see \cite{growthpaper}.

\subsubsection{An anisotropic network model based on entropic
  elasticity}
\label{anisotropic-network-elasticity}

The partial first Piola-Kirchhoff stress of collagen, modelled as a
hyperelastic material, is $\bP^{\,\mathrm{c}} = \rho_0^\mathrm{c} \partial
\psi^\mathrm{c}/ \partial\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}}$. Recall that
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}} = \bF\bF^{\mathrm{g}^{\mathrm{c}^{-1}}}$
is the elastic part, and
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{c}}$ 
is the growth part, respectively, of the deformation gradient, of
collagen. Following Equation 
(\ref{isotropicgrowth}), if we were considering unidirectional growth
of collagen along a unit vector $\be$, we would have
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{c}} = \frac{\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0}}
{\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}} \be \otimes \be$, with
$\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}$ denoting the initial
concentration of collagen at the point.

The mechanical response of tendons in tension is determined primarily
by their dominant structural component: highly oriented fibrils of
collagen. In our preliminary formulation, the strain energy density
for collagen has been obtained from hierarchical multi-scale
considerations based upon an entropic elasticity-based worm-like chain
(WLC) model \citep{KratkyPorod:49}. The WLC model has been widely used
for long chain single molecules, most prominently for DNA
\citep{MarkoSiggia:95,Riefetal:97,Bustamanteetal:2003}, and recently
for the collagen mono\-mer \citep{Sunetal:2002}. The central
parameters of this model are the chain's contour length, $L$, and
persistence length, $A$. The latter is a measure of its stiffness and
given by $A = \chi/k\theta$, where $\chi$ is the bending rigidity, $k$
is Boltzmann's constant and $\theta$ is the temperature. See
\citet{LandLif} for general formulation of statistical mechanics
models of long chain molecules. 

To model a collagen network structure, the
WLC model has been embedded as a single constituent chain of an
eight-chain model \citep{Bischoffetal:2002, Bischoffetal1:2002},
depicted in \mbox{Figure~\ref{eightchain}}.  Homogenisation via
averaging then leads to a continuum Helmholtz free energy function,
$\hat{\psi}^\mathrm{c}$:\footnote{Under the isothermal conditions
  assumed here, $\hat{\psi}^\mathrm{c}$ is independent of
  $\theta$ in the 
  strain energy. Accordingly, we have the parametrisation
  ${\psi}^\mathrm{c}=\hat{\psi}^\mathrm{c}
  (\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}},\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0})$ .}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0}\hat{\psi}^\mathrm{c} (\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{c}},\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0})
&= \frac{N k \theta}{4 A}\left(\frac{r^2}{2L} + \frac{L}{4(1-r/L)} -
\frac{r}{4}\right)\\ & +
\frac{\gamma}{\beta}({J^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}^{-2\beta}}}} -1) +
\gamma{\bf 1}\colon(\bC^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}}}-{\bf 1})\\ &-\frac{N
k \theta}{4\sqrt{2L/A}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{2A}{L}} + \frac{1}{4(1 -
\sqrt{2A/L})} -\frac{1}{4} \right) Z,\\ Z &=
\log\left(\lambda_1^{{\mathrm{e}}^{a^\mathrm{2}}}
\lambda_2^{{\mathrm{e}}^{b^\mathrm{2}}}
\lambda_3^{{\mathrm{e}}^{c^\mathrm{2}}}\right).
\label{wlcmeq}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Here, $N$ is
the density of chains, and $a,b$ and $c$ are lengths of the unit cell
sides aligned with the principal stretch directions. The material
model is isotropic only if $a=b=c$.

The elastic stretches along the unit cell axes are, respectively,
denoted by
$\lambda_1^{\mathrm{e}},
\lambda_2^{\mathrm{e}}$ 
and 
$\lambda_3^{\mathrm{e}}$, $\bC^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}}} =
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{T}}}}
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}}}$ is the elastic right Cauchy-Green
tensor of collagen. The factors $\gamma$ and $\beta$ control
the bulk compressibility of the model. The end to end chain length is
given by $r = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{a^2\lambda_1^{\mathrm{e}^2} +
  b^2\lambda_2^{\mathrm{e}^2}+c^2\lambda_3^{\mathrm{e}^2}}$, where
$\lambda^\mathrm{e}_I = 
\sqrt{\bN_I\cdot\bC^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{c}}}\bN_I}$, and $\bN_I,\,I =
1,2,3$ are the unit vectors along the three unit cell axes,
respectively. In our numerical simulations that appear below in
Section~\ref{numericalimplementation}, the numerical values used for
the parameters introduced in (\ref{wlcmeq}) are based on those in
\citet{kuhlremod05}.

\subsubsection{A nearly incompressible ideal fluid}
\label{ideal-incompressible-fluid}

In this preliminary work, the fluid phase is treated as nearly
incompressible and ideal, i.e., inviscid. The partial Cauchy
stress in the fluid is
\begin{equation}
\Bsigma^\mathrm{f} =
\mathrm{det}(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}
\bP^{\,\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{fT}} 
= h(\rho^\mathrm{f}){\bf 1},\label{Pf}
\end{equation}

\noindent where a large value of $h^\prime(\rho^\mathrm{f})$ ensures
near-in\-comp\-ress\-i\-bil\-i\-ty. 

{\bf Response of the fluid in tension; cavitation}\\

The response of the ideal fluid, as defined by \mbox{Equation
  (\ref{Pf})}, does not distinguish between tension and compression,
  i.e., whether 
$\mathrm{det}(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}) \gtreqless 1$. Being
(nearly) incompressible, the fluid can develop compressive hydrostatic
  stress
without bound---a case that is modelled accurately. However, the fluid
can develop at most a small tensile hydrostatic stress
\citep{cavitationchris},\footnote{Where, we are referring to the fluid
  being subject to net tension, not a reduction in fluid compressive
  stress from reference ambient pressure.} and the tensile
stiffness is mainly from the collagen phase. This is not accurately
represented by (\ref{Pf}), which models a symmetric response in
tension and compression.

Here, we preclude all tensile load carrying by the fluid by limiting
$\mathrm{det}(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}) \leq 1$. We first introduce
an additional component to the relation between 
deformation of the pore space, given by $\bF$, the fluid
stress-determining tensor, 
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$ and the growth tensor for the fluid,
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$. Consider the cavitation (void forming) tensor,
$\bF^{\mathrm{v}}$, defined by
  
\begin{equation}
 \bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}
 \bF^{\mathrm{v}} = \bF.
\label{fvoid}
\end{equation}


We restrict the formulation to include only saturated current
configurations at $t = 0$. Following Section \ref{satswel} we have
$\tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} + \tilde{v}^\mathrm{c} = 1$ at $t = 0$, the saturation
condition in $\Omega_t$ when solutes are at low
concentrations. At times $t > 0$ Equation (\ref{saturation}) holds for
$\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}}$. If
$\mathrm{det}[\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}] \le 1$ we set
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} = \bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}$
and $\bF^{\mathrm{v}} = {\bf 1}$ for no cavitation. Otherwise, since
$\mathrm{det}[\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}] > 1$, we specify
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} =
\mathrm{det}[\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}]^{-1/3}\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}$
thus restricting
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$ to be unimodular and allow cavitation by
writing $\bF^{\mathrm{v}} = \bF(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}$.
These conditional relations are summarized as 

\begin{equation}
\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
  \bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1},\; \bF^{\mathrm{v}} = {\bf 1},&
 \mathrm{det}[\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}] \le 1\\
  \mathrm{det}[\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}]^{-1/3}\bF(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1},
  & \\
  \qquad\qquad \bF^{\mathrm{v}} = \bF(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}\bF^{\mathrm{g}^\mathrm{f}})^{-1}
  & \mathrm{otherwise.}
\end{array}\right.
\label{cavitation}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Constitutive relationships for fluid flux}
\label{fluid-flux-constitutive-relationships}

Turning to (\ref{VIconstrel1}), we first point out that since
$\bM^\iota = \rho_0^\iota\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota$, this is an implicit
relation for $\bV^\iota$. Rewriting it as an explicit one for
$\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota$ we have,
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^\iota_0\bV^\iota =& &\left(\bone +
\frac{\tilde{\bD}^\iota\Bnabla\bV\bF^{-1}}{\rho^\iota_0}\right)^{-1}\frac{\tilde{\bD}^\iota}{\rho^\iota_0}\nonumber\\
& &\cdot\left\{-\left(\rho^\iota_0\frac{\partial\bV}{\partial t} -
\rho_0^\iota\bg - \Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota +
\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}\left(\Bnabla e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right)\right)\right\}. \label{VIconstrel2}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent The constitutive relation for flux, $\bM^\iota =
\rho^\iota_0\bF^{-1}\bV^\iota$ is then obtained:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bM^\iota & &=\underbrace{\bF^{-1}\left(\bone +
\frac{\tilde{\bD}^\iota\Bnabla\bV\bF^{-1}}{\rho^\iota_0}\right)^{-1}\frac{\tilde{\bD}^\iota}{\rho^\iota_0}\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}}_{\bD^\iota}\nonumber\\
&\cdot&\left\{\underbrace{-\left(\rho^\iota_0\bF^\mathrm{T}\frac{\partial\bV}{\partial
t} - \rho_0^\iota\bF^\mathrm{T}\bg -
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota + \rho^\iota_0\left(\Bnabla
e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right)\right)}_{\boldmath{\sF}^\iota}\right\}.
\label{MIconstrel}
\end{eqnarray}

As is common in descriptions of mass transport, the tensor
delineated as $\bD^\iota$ will be referred to as the mobility
tensor of species $\iota$. Recall that in (\ref{VIconstrel1}) we
have taken $\tilde{\bD}^\iota$ to be positive
semi-definite\footnote{If
$\Vert\tilde{\bD}^\iota\Bnabla\bV\bF^{-1}/\rho^\iota_0\Vert << 1$,
we have $\bD^\iota \approx \tilde{\bD}^\iota$.}. The flux is thus
written as the product of a mobility tensor and a thermodynamic
driving force, $\boldmath{\sF}^\iota$. This is the Nernst-Einstein
relation. We proceed now to examine the four separate terms in the
thermodynamic driving force:
\begin{equation}
\boldmath{\sF}^\iota =
-\rho^\iota_0\bF^\mathrm{T}\frac{\partial\bV}{\partial t} +
\rho_0^\iota\bF^\mathrm{T}\bg +
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota - \rho^\iota_0\left(\Bnabla
e^\iota - \theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right) \label{drivingforceI}
\end{equation}

\noindent The first two terms respectively represent the
influences of inertia and body force. Thus, the inertial effect is
to drive species $\iota$ in the opposite direction to the body's
acceleration. The body force's influence is directed along itself.
The third term represents the stress divergence effect. In the
case of a non-uniform partial stress, $\bP^\iota$, there exists a
thermodynamic driving force for transport along $\bP^\iota$. We
demonstrate this effect for the case of the fluid species in
Section \ref{sect5.2} below, for which it translates to the more
intuitive notion of transport along a fluid pressure gradient.

The fourth term in $\boldmath{\sF}^\iota$ admits the following
interpretation: The Legendre transformation $\psi^\iota = e^\iota
- \theta\eta^\iota$ allows one to rewrite $\Bnabla e^\iota -
\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota$ as $\Bnabla\psi^\iota\vert_\theta$ (at
uniform temperature), where $\psi^\iota$ is the mass-specific
Helmholtz free energy. An assumption inherent in the development
that began in Section \ref{sect2} is that any mass entering or
leaving $\Omega_0$ at a point $\bX$ on the boundary,
$\partial\Omega_0$, has the field values
$\rho_0^\iota,e^\iota,\eta^\iota,\theta$, and $\psi^\iota$
corresponding to $\bX$. Likewise, the incremental mass of species
$\iota$ created or absorbed via the source/sink $\Pi^\iota$ at
$\bX$ has the field values of that point. Consider a sufficiently
small neighborhood of a point, say
$\mathsf{N}(\bX)\subset\Omega_0$. Changing the mass of species
$\iota$ in $\mathsf{N}(\bX)$ by $\delta\mathsf{m}^\iota$ units
causes a change in the Helmholtz free energy of $\iota$ in
$\mathsf{N}(\bX)$ by $\delta\Psi^\iota =
\psi^\iota\delta\mathsf{m}^\iota$. By definition therefore,
$\psi^\iota =
\partial\Psi^\iota/\partial\mathsf{m}^\iota$. This derivative gives the \emph{chemical
potential}, $\mu^\iota$, of the transported species, $\iota$.
Thus, we have $\mu^\iota = e^\iota - \theta\eta^\iota$, and
$\Bnabla e^\iota -\theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota =
\Bnabla\mu^\iota\vert_\theta$. This last term in
${\boldmath{\sF}}^\iota$ thus represents the thermodynamic driving
force due to a chemical potential gradient.

It has recently come to our attention that the constitutive
relation for flux (\ref{MIconstrel}) is precisely the result
arrived at by \citet{DeGrootMazur:1984}, including the
identification of the chemical potential gradient term. However,
their approach involves a slightly different application of the
Second Law, and a less detailed treatment of the mechanics.

The gradient of internal energy in (\ref{drivingforceI}) leads to
a strain gradient-dependent term. A concentration gradient-driven
term arises from the gradient of mixing entropy. Together with the
other terms that were remarked upon above, they represent a
complete thermodynamic formulation of coupled mass transport and
mechanics. This is the central result of our paper.

{\bf  Frame invariance and the contribution from acceleration}\\

In our earlier treatment \citep{growthpaper}, the constitutive
relation for the fluid flux had a driving force contribution arising
from the acceleration of the solid phase,
$-\rho_0^\mathrm{f}\bF^{\mathrm{T}}\frac{\partial \bV}{\partial t}$.
This term, being motivated by the reduced dissipation inequality, does
not violate the Second Law and supports an intuitive understanding
that the acceleration of the solid skeleton in one direction must result in
an inertial driving force on the fluid in the opposite
direction. However, as defined, this acceleration is obtained by the
time differentiation of kinematic quantities,\footnote{And not in terms
of acceleration {\em relative to fixed stars} for e.g., as discussed
in \cite[][Page 43]{TruesdellNoll:65}.} and does not transform in a
frame-indifferent manner. Unlike the superficially similar term
arising from the gravity vector,\footnote{Where every observer has an
implicit knowledge of the directionality of the field relative to a
fixed frame, allowing it to transform objectively. Specifically, under
a time-dependent rigid body motion imposed on the current
configuration carrying $\bx$ to $\bx^+ = \bc(t) + \bQ(t)\bx$, where
$\bc(t) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\bQ(t) \in \mbox{SO}(3)$, it is
understood that the acceleration due to gravity in the transformed
frame is $\bg^+ = \bQ^\mathrm{T}\bg$ and is therefore
frame-invariant. However, $\ba^+ = \ddot{\bc} + 2\dot{\bQ}\bv +
\ddot{\bQ}\bx + \bQ\ba$ , and is therefore not frame-invariant.} the
acceleration 
term presents an improper dependence on the frame of the
observer. Thus, its use in constitutive relations is inappropriate,
and the term has been dropped in \mbox{Equation (\ref{fluidflux})}.

{\bf Transport of a the fluid species: the example of an ideal fluid}

Consider the stress divergence term
$\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota$. An elementary calculation
gives
\begin{equation}
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota =
\Bnabla\cdot\left(\bF^\mathrm{T}\bP^\iota\right) -
\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bP^\iota. \label{stressdivI}
\end{equation}

\noindent In indicial form, where lower/upper case indices are for
components of quantities in the current/reference configuration
respectively, this relation is
\begin{displaymath}
F_{iK}P^\iota_{iJ,J} = \left(F_{iK}P^\iota_{iJ}\right)_{,J} -
F_{iK,J}P^\iota_{iJ}.
\end{displaymath}

\noindent For an ideal fluid, supporting only an isotropic Cauchy
stress, $p\bone$, we have $\bP^\mathrm{f} =
\mathrm{det}(\bF)p\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}$, where $p$ is positive in
tension. The arguments that follow assume this case. (The more
general case of a non-ideal, viscous fluid will merely have
additional terms from the viscous Cauchy stress.) The stress
divergence term is
\begin{equation}
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\mathrm{f} =
\Bnabla\left(\mathrm{det}(\bF)p\right) -
\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{det}(\bF)p,
\end{equation}

\noindent demonstrating the appearance of a hydrostatic
stress-driven contribution to ${\boldmath{\sF}}^\mathrm{f}$. This
is Darcy's Law for transport of a fluid down a pressure gradient.

For the special case of a compressible, ideal fluid we have
$e^\mathrm{f} =
\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}(\eta^\mathrm{f},\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f})$; i.e.,
the fluid stores strain energy as a function of its \emph{current,
intrinsic} density. Fluid saturation conditions hold in biological
tissue, for which case the fluid volume fraction, $f^\mathrm{f}$,
is simply the pore volume fraction. Recall from Section
\ref{sect2} that the individual species deform with the common
deformation gradient $\bF$. Therefore the pores deform
\emph{homogeneously} with the surrounding solid phase. Physically
this corresponds to the pore size being smaller than the scale at
which the homogenization assumption of a continuum theory holds.
Momentarily ignoring changes in reference concentration of the
fluid, we have $\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}} = \bF$.  Then, since
$\rho^\mathrm{f}_0 = \bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}_0 f^\mathrm{f}$, we can
write $\hat{e}^\mathrm{f}(\bF,\eta^\mathrm{f},\rho^\mathrm{f}_0) =
\hat{e}^\mathrm{f}(\bF,\eta^\mathrm{f},\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}_0
f^\mathrm{f}) =
\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}(\eta^\mathrm{f},\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}_0/\mathrm{det}\bF)=
\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}(\eta^\mathrm{f},\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f})$. In
this case a simple calculation shows that the hydrostatic pressure
is
\begin{displaymath}
p =
-\frac{\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}}{\mathrm{det}(\bF)}\frac{\partial\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}}{\partial\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}},
\end{displaymath}

\noindent and the stress divergence term is
\begin{displaymath}
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\mathrm{f} =
-\Bnabla\left(\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}\frac{\partial\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}}{\partial\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}}\right)
+
\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bF^{-\mathrm{T}}\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}\frac{\partial\bar{e}^\mathrm{f}}{\partial\bar{\rho}^\mathrm{f}}.
\end{displaymath}

{\bf The Eshelby stress as a thermodynamic driving force}
\label{eshelby-force}

Combining the stress divergence and chemical potential gradient
contributions to the driving force for any species, and using the
mass-specific Helmholtz free energy, $\psi^\iota$, we write,

\begin{equation}
\bF^\mathrm{T}\Bnabla\cdot\bP^\iota - \rho^\iota_0\left(\Bnabla
e^\iota - \theta\Bnabla\eta^\iota\right) =
\Bnabla\cdot\left(\bF^\mathrm{T}\bP^\iota\right) -
\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bP^\iota
 - \rho^\iota_0\Bnabla\psi^\iota\vert_\theta.
\end{equation}

\noindent Regrouping terms this expression is
\begin{equation}
-\Bnabla\cdot\underbrace{\left(\rho^\iota_0\psi^\iota\vert_\theta\bone
- \bF^\mathrm{T}\bP^\iota\right)}_{\mbox{Eshelby
stress},\;\BXi^\iota} +
\left(\Bnabla\rho^\iota_0\right)\psi^\iota_0\vert_\theta -
\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bP^\iota.
\end{equation}

Thus, the divergence of the well-known Eshelby stress tensor is
also among the driving forces for mass transport. Also observe the
presence of a strain gradient-dependent driving force,
$-\Bnabla\bF^\mathrm{T}\colon\bP^\iota$ in the developments of
Sections \ref{sect5.2} and \ref{sect5.3}, independent of the
pressure gradient term for the fluid species.

\noindent{\bf Remark 1}: The final version of the dissipation
inequality (\ref{dissipation1}), and the mass balance equation can
be manipulated to restrict the mathematical form of the mass
source. It is common to make the mass source depend upon the
strain energy density \citep{HarriganHamilton:1993} while
respecting the restriction imposed by the dissipation inequality.
This form is often used while modelling hard tissue. Such an
approach leads to strain-mediated mass transport. However, with a
strain-independent source, strain-mediated (or stress-mediated)
mass transport would not be obtained with such a formulation.

\noindent{\bf Remark 2}: We expect that evaluation of the
dissipation, $\sD$, using (\ref{dissipation1}) from field
quantities in a boundary value problem will provide a test of
soundness, and if necessary indications for improvement, of our
constitutive models.

\noindent{\bf Remark 3}: Since soft biological tissues usually
demonstrate rate-dependent response, it has been common to employ
a solid viscoelastic constitutive model for them. This approach
fits within our framework, with a modification of the internal
energy to include its dependence upon internal variables that
represent the viscoelastic stress-like parameters. However, a more
physiologically-valid model may be one with a purely hyperelastic
solid phase, and a viscous fluid. In such a composite model the
rate-dependent behavior would arise from the fluid.

\noindent{\bf Remark 4}: The constitutive relations
(\ref{stress-constrelI}) and (\ref{MIconstrel}) respectively
specify the partial stress, $\bP^\iota$, and flux, $\bM^\iota$, of
a species. The flux also implies the relative velocity,
$\bV^\iota$. The velocity of the solid phase, $\bV$ is obtained
from the local form of the balance of linear momentum for the
system (\ref{linmombalsys}). With all these quantities known, the
individual interaction forces between species,
$\rho^\iota_0\bq^\iota$, can be obtained from
(\ref{ballinmomrefI}). They are, however, not needed while solving
for the balance of linear momentum of the system.

\hrule

From \citet{growthpaper}, the constitutive relation for the flux of 
extra-cellular fluid relative to collagen in the reference
configuration takes the following form,

\begin{equation}
\bM^\mathrm{f} = \bD^\mathrm{f}\left(\rho_0^\mathrm{f}\bF^T\bg +
      \bF^T\mathrm{\small{DIV}}\left[\bP^{\,\mathrm{f}}\right] -
      \rho_0^\mathrm{f}\mathrm{\small{GRAD}}\mu^\mathrm{f}\right),
\label{fluidflux}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bD^\mathrm{f}$ is the positive semi-definite
mobility of the fluid, and isothermal conditions are assumed in order to
approximate the physiological ones. Experimentally determined
transport coefficients (e.g. for mouse tail skin \citep{Swartzetal:99}
and rabbit Achilles tendons \citep{Hanetal:2000}) are used for the
fluid mobility values. The terms in the parenthesis on the right
hand-side of \mbox{Equation (\ref{fluidflux})} sum to give the
total driving force for transport. The first term is the contribution
due to gravitational acceleration. In order to maintain physiological
relevance, this term has been neglected in the following
treatment. The second term arises from stress divergence; for an ideal
fluid, it reduces to a pressure gradient, thereby specifying that the
fluid moves down a compressive pressure gradient, which is Darcy's
Law. The third term is the gradient of the chemical
potential, $\mu^\mathrm{f} = e^\mathrm{f} - \theta \eta^\mathrm{f}$,
where $e^\mathrm{f}$ is the mass-specific internal energy, $\theta$ is
temperature and $\eta^\mathrm{f}$ is the mass-specific entropy. The
entropy gradient included in this term results in 
classical Fickean diffusion if only mixing entropy exists, as
discussed in the following section. For a
detailed derivation and discussion of \mbox{Equation
(\ref{fluidflux})}, the reader is directed to \citet{growthpaper}.

%Since the driving forces in (\ref{fluidflux}) originate from different
%physics, it proves useful (as seen in the following section) to
%rewrite (\ref{fluidflux}) as

%\begin{equation}
%\bM^\mathrm{f} = \bD^\mathrm{f}_{P} \bF^T\mathrm{\small{DIV}}
%\left[\bP^{\,\mathrm{f}}\right] - \bD^\mathrm{f}_{\mu}
%\mathrm{\small{GRAD}}\left[e^\mathrm{f} -
%  \theta\eta^\mathrm{f}\right],
%\label{splitflux}
%\end{equation}

%\noindent where $\bD^\mathrm{f}_{P}$ is now the permeability of the
%tissue, corresponding to stress gradient-driven transport, and
%$\bD^\mathrm{f}_{\mu}$ is the mobility, corresponding to chemical
%potential gradient-driven transport, of the fluid phase through the
%porous solid.

{\bf Saturation and Fickean diffusion}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfrag{A}{\small A}
\psfrag{B}{\small B}
\psfrag{C}{\small C}
\psfrag{D}{\small Vacant space}
\psfrag{E}{\small Filled space}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/elucidation/saturation}
\caption{Depicted at a microscopic scale, only unsaturated tissues A
  and B can undergo Fickean diffusion of the fluid. C is saturated.}
\label{fick_fig}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure~\ref{fick_fig}, only when pores are unsaturated
are there multiple configurations 
available to the fluid molecules at a fixed fluid concentration.  This
leads to a non-zero mixing entropy. In contrast, if saturated, there
is a single available configuration (degeneracy), resulting in
zero mixing entropy. Consequently, Fickean diffusion, which arises
from the gradient of mixing entropy can exist only in the unsaturated
case. However, even a saturated pore structure can demonstrate
concentration gradient-dependent mass transport phenomenologically: The
fluid stress depends on fluid concentration (see Equation (\ref{Pf})),
and fluid stress gradient-driven flux appears as a concentration
gradient-driven flux.

The saturation dependence of Fickean diffusion is modelled by using
the measure of saturation introduced in Section~\ref{satswel}. We
rewrite the chemical potential as

\begin{eqnarray}
\mu^\mathrm{f} &=&  
e^\mathrm{f} - \theta\eta^\mathrm{f},\nonumber\\
\eta^\mathrm{f} &\to& 0, \quad \mbox{as}\, \tilde{v}^\mathrm{f} +
\tilde{v}^\mathrm{c} \to 1.
\label{fickeanmobility}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent It is again important to note that under physiological
conditions, soft tissues are fully saturated by fluid, and it is
appropriate to set $\mu^\mathrm{f} = e^\mathrm{f}$.

\subsubsection{Solute transport}
\label{solute-transport}

The dissolved solute species, denoted by s, undergo long range
transport primarily by being 
advected by the fluid. In addition to this, they undergo diffusive
transport relative to the fluid. This motivates an additional velocity
split of the form $\bV^s=\widetilde{\bV^\mathrm{s}}+\bV^\mathrm{f}$,
where $\widetilde{\bV^\mathrm{s}}$ denotes the velocity of the solute
relative to the fluid. The constitutive relation for the corresponding
flux, denoted by $\widetilde{\bM^s}$, has the following form, similar
to Equation (\ref {fluidflux}) defined for the fluid flux.

%TODO: Remove occurrences of \tilde{v}

\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\bM^\mathrm{s}} = \bD^\mathrm{s}\left(
- \rho^\mathrm{s}_0\mathrm{\small{GRAD}}\left[e^\mathrm{s} -
 \theta\eta^\mathrm{s}\right]\right),
\label{soluteflux}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bD^\mathrm{s}$ is the positive semi-definite
mobility of the solute relative to the fluid, and again, isothermal
conditions are assumed to approximate the physiological
ones. Following Section \ref{bomom} there are no stress-dependent
contributions to $\widetilde{\bM^\mathrm{s}}$.

\subsubsection{Nature of the sources}
\label{nature-of-sources}

There exists a large body of literature,
\citep{CowinHegedus:76,EpsteinMaugin:2000,AmbrosiMollica:2002}, that
addresses growth in biological tissue mainly based upon a single
species undergoing transport and production/annihilation. However,
when chemistry is accounted for, it is apparent that growth depends on
cascades of complex biochemical reactions involving several species,
and additionally involves intimate coupling between mass transfer,
biochemistry and mechanics. An example of this chemo-mechanical
coupling is described in \cite{Provenzanoetal:2003}.

The modelling approach followed in this work is to select appropriate
functional forms of the source terms for collagen, $\Pi^{\mathrm{c}}$,
and the solutes, $\Pi^{\mathrm{s}}$, that abstract the complexity of
the biochemistry. In our earlier exposition \citep{growthpaper}, we
used simple first order chemical kinetics to define
$\Pi^{\mathrm{c}}$. Other forms, which have been studied in the
literature, can be used: 

(\romannumeral 1) {\em Michaelis-Menten}
enzyme kinetics (see, for 
e.g., \cite{Sengersetal:2004}), which involves a two-step reaction
with the collagen and solute production terms given by

\begin{equation}
\Pi^\mathrm{s} =
    \frac{-(k_{\mathrm{max}}\rho^{\mathrm{s}})}
    {(\rho^{\mathrm{s}}_m+\rho^{\mathrm{s}})}
    \rho_{\mathrm{cell}}, \quad\Pi^\mathrm{c} = -\Pi^\mathrm{s},
\label{enzymekineticseq}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rho_{\mathrm{cell}}$ is the concentration of
fibroblasts, $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum value of the solute
production reaction rate constant, and $\rho^{\mathrm{s}}_m$ is half
the solute concentration corresponding to $k_{\mathrm{max}}$. For
details on the chemistry modelled by the Michaelis-Menten model, see,
for e.g., \citet{sbromadill}.

(\romannumeral 2) {\em Strain energy-dependent} sources that
induce growth at a point when the 
energy density deviates from a reference value. An example of source terms
of this form was
originally proposed in the context of bone growth 
\citep{HarriganHamilton:93}. We are not aware of studies that have
developed similar functional forms for soft tissue, and therefore have
adapted this example from the bone growth literature, recognizing that
this topic is in need of further study. Suitably weighted by a
relative concentration ratio, and written for collagen, this source
term has the form 

\begin{equation}
\Pi^\mathrm{c} =
\left(\frac{\rho^\mathrm{c}_0}{\rho^\mathrm{c}_{0_\mathrm{ini}}}\right)^{-m}
\psi_{\mathrm{F}}-\psi_{\mathrm{F}}^*,
\label{strainsrc}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi_{\mathrm{F}}$ is the mass-specific strain energy
function, and $\psi_{\mathrm{F}}^*$ is a reference value of this
strain energy density. Equation (\ref{strainsrc}) models collagen
production when the strain energy density (weighted by a concentration
ratio) at a point exceeds this reference value, and models 
annihilation otherwise.

\section{Algorithmic considerations}
\label{algorithmic-considerations-1}

\todo{Some descriptive text goes here.}

\subsection{The role of mass balance in the current
  configuration}
\label{role-of-current-mass-balance} 

In order to proceed, we must first introduce the central kinematic
assumption underlying the 
formulation: We assume that the pore structure deforms with the
collagenous phase. Therefore, the deformation gradient, $\bF$, is
common to c and the fluid-filled pore spaces. Furthermore, in what
follows, we will treat the fluid as ideal and nearly-incompressible,
i.e. as elastic (Section \ref{compfluid}). This combination of
kinematic and constitutive assumptions to be elaborated upon, implies
that the stress in the fluid phase is determined by the elastic part of
$\bF$ (see Sections \ref{growthkinem} and
\ref{compfluid}). For clarity we denote it as
$\bF^{\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{f}}$. Importantly, the pore-filling fluid under stress
can also undergo transport relative to the pore network; i.e.,
relative to the collagenous phase. This is the fluid flux, denoted by
$\bM^\mathrm{f}$ in the reference configuration. Note that the
specification of constitutive relations for the flux is still open at
this point in the discussion. At the outset, we preclude stress in any
of the solute species, s. Only the solid collagen and fluid bear
stress. 

Although the initial/boundary value problem of mass transport can be
consistently posed in the reference configuration, the evolving
current configuration, $\Omega_t$, is of greater interest from a
physical standpoint for growth problems. It follows from the
discussion in the preceding paragraph that the shape and size of
pores in $\Omega_t$ is determined by $\bF$. Therefore, at
the boundary, the fluid concentration with 
respect to $\Omega_t$ remains constant if the boundary is in contact
with a fluid bath.  Accordingly, this is the appropriate Dirichlet
boundary condition to impose under normal physiological
conditions. This is shown in an idealised manner in Figure~\ref{fbc}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/elucidation/concentration}
\caption{If the pore structure at the boundary deforms with the
tissue and this boundary is in contact with a fluid bath, the
fluid concentration with respect to the current configuration,
i.e., $\rho^\mathrm{f}$, remains constant.}\label{fbc}
\end{figure}

In the interest of applying boundary conditions (either specification
of species flux or concentration) that are physically meaningful, we
use the local form of the balance of mass in the current
configuration,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^\iota}{\mathrm{d}t} = \pi^\iota-
\mathrm{\small{div}}[\bm^\iota] - \rho^\iota
\mathrm{\small{div}}[\bv],\;\forall\,\iota, \label{massbalcurr}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rho^\iota(\bx,t),\pi^\iota(\bx,t)$, and
$\bm^\iota(\bx,t)$ are the current mass concentration, source and mass
flux of species $\iota$ respectively and $\bv(\bx,t)$ is the velocity
of the solid phase. They are related to corresponding reference
quantities as $\rho^\iota = \left(\mathrm{det} \left(\bF\right)
\right)^{-1} \rho_0^\iota$, $\pi^\iota = \left(\mathrm{det}
\left(\bF\right) \right)^{-1} \Pi^\iota$ and $\bm^\iota =
\left(\mathrm{det} \left(\bF\right) \right)^{-1} \bF \bM^\iota$. The
spatial divergence operator is $\mbox{\small{div} [\textbullet]}$, and
the left hand-side in Equation~(\ref{massbalcurr}) is the material
time derivative relative to the solid, which may be written explicitly as
$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\vert_X$, implying that the reference
position of the solid collagenous skeleton is held fixed.

\subsection{Incompressible fluid in a porous solid}
\label{incompressible-fluid-porous-solid}

Upon incorporation of the additional velocity split,
$\bV^\mathrm{s}=\widetilde{\bV^\mathrm{s}}+\bV^f$, described in
Section~\ref{solutespecies}, the resulting mass transport equation
(\ref{massbalcurr}) for the solute species is

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \pi^\mathrm{s}-
\mathrm{div} \left[\widetilde{\bm^\mathrm{s}}+
\frac{\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\rho^f}\bm^f\right] - \rho^\mathrm{s}
\mathrm{div}[\bv].
\label{massbalcurrsol}
\end{equation}

\noindent In the hyperbolic limit, where advection dominates, spatial
oscillations emerge in numerical solutions of this equation
\citep{Brooks:82,Paper6}. However, the form in which the equation is
obtained is not in standard advection-diffusion form, and therefore is
not amenable to the application of standard stabilisation techniques
\citep{Paper6}. In part, this is because although the (near)
incompressibility of the fluid phase is embedded in the balance of
linear momentum via the fluid stress, it has not yet been explicitly
incorporated into the transport equations. This section proceeds to
impose the fluid incompressibility condition and deduces implications
for the solute mass transport equation, including a crucial
simplification allowing for its straightforward numerical
stabilisation.

From \mbox{Equation (\ref{massbalcurr})}, the local form of the
balance of mass for the fluid species (recalling that
$\Pi^\mathrm{f}=0$) in the current configuration is

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^f}{\mathrm{d}t} = - \mathrm{div}\left[\bm^f\right]
- \rho^f \mathrm{div}\left[\bv\right].
\label{fluidtransporteqn}
\end{equation}

\noindent In order to impose the incompressibility of the fluid, we
first denote by $\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^{f}$ the {\sl initial} value
of the fluid reference concentration. Recall that the fluid
concentration with respect to the reference configuration evolves in
time; $\rho^\mathrm{f}_0 = \rho^\mathrm{f}_0(\bX,t)$. Therefore we can
precisely, and non-trivially, define
$\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^{\mathrm{f}}(\bX)$   

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho_{0}^{\mathrm{f}}(\bX,0)
                   &=:\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^{\mathrm{f}}(\bX)\\ 
                   &=\rho_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\mathrm{f}}(\bx\circ\Bvarphi)
                   J(\bX, t)\\ &=\frac{\rho^{\mathrm{f}}
                   (\bx\circ\Bvarphi,t)} {J^{f_\mathrm{g}}(\bX,t)}
                   J(\bX,t)\\ &=\rho^{\mathrm{f}} (\bx\circ\Bvarphi,t)
                   \cancelto{\approx 1\ \forall\ t}
                   {J^{f_\mathrm{e}}}(\bX,t).\\
\label{incompderiv}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In (\ref{incompderiv}), $J := \mathrm{det}(\bF)$ and $J^{f_\mathrm{g}} :=
\mathrm{det}(\bF^{\mathrm{g}^{\mathrm{f}}})$. The quantity
$\rho_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ is defined by the right hand-sides
of the first and second lines of (\ref{incompderiv}). To follow the
argument, consider, momentarily, a \emph{compressible} fluid. If the
current concentration, $\rho^\mathrm{f}$, changes due to elastic
deformation of the fluid and by transport, then
$\rho_{\mathrm{ini}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ as defined is not a
physically-realized fluid concentration. It bears a purely
mathematical relation to the current concentration, $\rho^\mathrm{f}$,
since the latter quantity represents the effect of deformation of a
tissue point as well as change in mass due to transport at that
point. If the contribution due to mass change at a point is scaled
out of $\rho^\mathrm{f}$ the quotient is identical to the result of
dividing $\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^{\mathrm{f}}$ by the deformation
only. This is expressed in the relation between the right hand-sides
of the second and third lines of (\ref{incompderiv}). The elastic
component of fluid volume change in a pore is $J^{f_\mathrm{e}} :=
\mathrm{det}(\bF^{\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{f}}})$, which appears  in the third
line of (\ref{incompderiv}) via the preceding arguments. Clearly then,
for a fluid demonstrating near incompressibility intrinsically (i.e.,
the true density is nearly constant), we have $J^{f_\mathrm{e}}
\approx 1$ as indicated. Equation (\ref{incompderiv}) therefore shows
that for a nearly incompressible fluid occupying the pores of a
tissue, if we further assume that the pore structure deforms as the
solid collagenous skeleton, $\rho_0^\mathrm{f}(\bX,0) \approx
\rho^\mathrm{f}(\bx\circ\Bvarphi,t)$. The fluid concentration as
measured in the current configuration is approximately constant in
space and time. This allows us to write,


\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial} {\partial t}\left(
\rho_{0_{\mathrm{ini}}}^{f}(\bX) \right) \equiv 0 \Rightarrow
\frac{\partial} {\partial t}\left(\rho^{f} (\bx\circ\Bvarphi,t)
\right)\Big\vert_{\bX} = 0,
\end{equation}

\noindent which is the hidden implication of our assumption of a
homogeneous deformation, i.e., $\bF$ is the deformation gradient of
solid collagen and the pore spaces.  This leads to $\frac{\mathrm{d}
  \rho^f} {\mathrm{d} 
  t}=0$.\footnote{Which results in a very large pressure gradient
  driven flux due to incompressibility. } We
therefore proceed to treat our fluid mass transport at steady
state. Rewriting the flux $\bm^{\mathrm{f}}$ from \mbox{Equation
(\ref{fluidtransporteqn})} as the product $\rho^{\mathrm{f}}
\bv^{\mathrm{f}}$ and using the result derived above,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
0 &= \left. \frac{\partial \rho^f}{\partial t} \right|_{\bX}\\ &=
-\mathrm{div}\left[\rho^f \bv^{f}\right] - \rho^f
\mathrm{div}\left[\bv\right].
\end{split}
\label{incomprimpl}
\end{equation}

\noindent Returning to (\ref{massbalcurrsol}) with this result,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \pi^\mathrm{s}-
\mathrm{div} \left[\widetilde{\bm^\mathrm{s}}+
\frac{\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\rho^f}\bm^f\right] - \rho^\mathrm{s}
\mathrm{div}[\bv]\\ &= \frac{\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\rho^f}\left(\cancelto{0}
{-\mathrm{div}\left[\rho^f \bv^{f}\right] - \rho^f
\mathrm{div}[\bv]}\right)\\ &\quad{} + \pi^\mathrm{s} -
\mathrm{div}\left[\widetilde{\bm^\mathrm{s}}\right]
-\bm^f\cdot\mathrm{grad}\left[\frac{ \rho^\mathrm{s}}{\rho^f}\right].\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Thus, using the incompressibility condition (\ref{incomprimpl}), we
get the simplified form of the balance of mass for an arbitrary solute
species, s,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\pi^\mathrm{s} -
\mathrm{div}\left[\widetilde{\bm^\mathrm{s}}\right] -
\frac{\bm^f\cdot\mathrm{grad}\left[\rho^\mathrm{s}\right]}{\rho^f} +
\frac{\rho^\mathrm{s} \bm^f \cdot \mathrm{grad}\left[\rho^f\right]}
{\rho^{f^2}}.
\label{stdform}
\end{equation}

\noindent Using the pushed-forward form of (\ref{soluteflux}), this is
now in standard advection-diffusion form, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{d}t} - \underbrace{
 \mathrm{div}\left[\bar{\bD^\mathrm{s}} \mathrm{grad}
 \left[ \rho^\mathrm{s}\right]\right]}_\text{Diffusion term}
 - \underbrace{\pi^\mathrm{s}}_\text{Source term} =
\\ \ & - \underbrace{\frac{\bm^f\cdot\mathrm{grad}\left[\rho^\mathrm{s}\right]}{\rho^f}}
_\text{Advection term} +
\underbrace{ \frac{\rho^\mathrm{s} \bm^f \cdot \mathrm{grad}\left[\rho^f\right]}
     {\rho^{f^2}},}_\text{Additional, $\rho^\mathrm{s}$-dependent source term}
\end{split}
\label{morestdform}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bar{\bD^\mathrm{s}}$ is a positive semi-definite
diffusivity, $\bm^{f}/\rho^{f}$ is the advective velocity, and $
\pi^\mathrm{s}$ is the volumetric source term. This form is well
suited for stabilisation schemes such as the streamline upwind
Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method (see, for e.g., \cite{Paper6}), described
briefly below, which limit spatial oscillations otherwise observed
when the element {\em Peclet number} is large.

\subsection{Stabilisation of the simplified solute transport equation}
\label{stabilisation-solute-transport}

In weak form, the SUPG-stabilised method for
Equation~(\ref{morestdform}) is

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\int_{\Omega} w^{\mathrm{h}} \left(
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}}{\mathrm{d}t} +
  \bm^f\cdot\mathrm{grad}\left[\frac{
      \rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}}{\rho^f}\right] \right)
  d\Omega\\ &+\int_{\Omega} \left( \mathrm{grad}
  \left[w^{\mathrm{h}}\right] \cdot \bar{\bD^\mathrm{s}} \mathrm{grad}
  \left[ \rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}\right] \right)\ d\Omega\\ +&
  \sum_{\mathrm{e}=1}^{\mathrm{n_{el}}} \int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{e}}}
  \tau \frac{\bm^{f}}{\rho^f} \cdot \mathrm{grad} \left[w^{\mathrm{h}}\right] \left(
  \frac{\mathrm{d}\rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}}{\mathrm{d}t} +
  \bm^f\cdot\mathrm{grad}\left[\frac{
      \rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}}{\rho^f}\right] \right) \ d\Omega\\ -&
  \sum_{\mathrm{e}=1}^{\mathrm{n_{el}}} \int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{e}}}
  \tau \frac{\bm^{f}}{\rho^f} \cdot \mathrm{grad} \left[w^{\mathrm{h}}\right]
  \left(\mathrm{div}\left[\bar{\bD^\mathrm{s}}\ \mathrm{grad} \left[
      \rho^{\mathrm{s}^{h}}\right]\right]\right) \ d\Omega\\ = &
  \int_{\Omega} w^{\mathrm{h}} \pi^\mathrm{s} \ d\Omega +
  \int_{\Gamma_{\mathrm{h}}} w^{\mathrm{h}} h \ d\Gamma\\ +&
  \sum_{\mathrm{e}=1}^{\mathrm{n_{el}}} \int_{\Omega_{\mathrm{e}}}
  \tau \frac{\bm^{f}}{\rho^f} \cdot \mathrm{grad} \left[w^{\mathrm{h}}\right]
  \pi^\mathrm{s} \ d\Omega,
\label{stabilizedmassbal}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where quantities with the superscript $\mathrm{h}$ represent
finite-di\-men\-sion\-al approximations of infinite-dimensional field
variables, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{h}}$ is the Neumann boundary, and 
this equation introduces a numerical stabilisation parameter $\tau$,
which we have calculated from the $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ norms of element
level matrices, as described in
\cite{tezduyarsupg}.
